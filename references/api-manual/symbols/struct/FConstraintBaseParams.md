## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stiffness | float | Stiffness of the soft constraint. Only used when Soft Constraint is on. |  |
| Damping | float | Damping of the soft constraint. Only used when Soft Constraint is on. |  |
| Restitution | float | Controls the amount of bounce when the constraint is violated. A restitution value of 1 will bounce back with the same velocity the limit was hit. A value of 0 will stop dead. |  |
| ContactDistance | float | Determines how close to the limit we have to get before turning the joint on. Larger value will be more expensive, but will do a better job not violating constraints. A smaller value will be more efficient, but easier to violate. |  |
| bSoftConstraint | uint8 | Whether we want to use a soft constraint (spring). |  |
