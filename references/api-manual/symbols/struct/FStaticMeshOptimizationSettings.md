Old optimization settings.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ReductionMethod | TEnumAsByte < enum EOptimizationType > | The method to use when optimizing the skeletal mesh LOD |  |
| NumOfTrianglesPercentage | float | If ReductionMethod equals SMOT_NumOfTriangles this value is the ratio of triangles [0-1] to remove from the mesh |  |
| MaxDeviationPercentage | float | If ReductionMethod equals SMOT_MaxDeviation this value is the maximum deviation from the base mesh as a percentage of the bounding sphere. |  |
| WeldingThreshold | float | The welding threshold distance. Vertices under this distance will be welded. |  |
| bRecalcNormals | bool | Whether Normal smoothing groups should be preserved. If false then NormalsThreshold is used |  |
| NormalsThreshold | float | If the angle between two triangles are above this value, the normals will not be<br>	smooth over the edge between those two triangles. Set in degrees. This is only used when PreserveNormals is set to false |  |
| SilhouetteImportance | uint8 | How important the shape of the geometry is (EImportanceLevel). |  |
| TextureImportance | uint8 | How important texture density is (EImportanceLevel). |  |
| ShadingImportance | uint8 | How important shading quality is. |  |
