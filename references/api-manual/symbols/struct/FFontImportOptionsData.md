## Description

Font import options

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FontName | FString | Name of the typeface for the font to import |  |
| Height | float | Height of font (point size) |  |
| bEnableAntialiasing | uint32 | Whether the font should be antialiased or not.  Usually you should leave this enabled. |  |
| bEnableBold | uint32 | Whether the font should be generated in bold or not |  |
| bEnableItalic | uint32 | Whether the font should be generated in italics or not |  |
| bEnableUnderline | uint32 | Whether the font should be generated with an underline or not |  |
| bAlphaOnly | uint32 | if true then forces PF_G8 and only maintains Alpha value and discards color |  |
| CharacterSet | TEnumAsByte < enum EFontImportCharacterSet > | Character set for this font |  |
| Chars | FString | Explicit list of characters to include in the font |  |
| UnicodeRange | FString | Range of Unicode character values to include in the font.  You can specify ranges using hyphens andor commas (e.g. '400-900') |  |
| CharsFilePath | FString | Path on disk to a folder where files that contain a list of characters to include in the font |  |
| CharsFileWildcard | FString | File mask wildcard that specifies which files within the CharsFilePath to scan for characters in include in the font |  |
| bCreatePrintableOnly | uint32 | Skips generation of glyphs for any characters that are not considered 'printable' |  |
| bIncludeASCIIRange | uint32 | When specifying a range of characters and this is enabled, forces ASCII characters (0 thru 255) to be included as well |  |
| ForegroundColor | FLinearColor | Color of the foreground font pixels.  Usually you should leave this white and instead use the UI Styles editor to change the color of the font on the fly |  |
| bEnableDropShadow | uint32 | Enables a very simple, 1-pixel, black colored drop shadow for the generated font |  |
| TexturePageWidth | int32 | Horizontal size of each texture page for this font in pixels |  |
| TexturePageMaxHeight | int32 | The maximum vertical size of a texture page for this font in pixels.  The actual height of a texture page may be less than this if the font can fit within a smaller sized texture page. |  |
| XPadding | int32 | Horizontal padding between each font character on the texture page in pixels |  |
| YPadding | int32 | Vertical padding between each font character on the texture page in pixels |  |
| ExtendBoxTop | int32 | How much to extend the top of the UV coordinate rectangle for each character in pixels |  |
| ExtendBoxBottom | int32 | How much to extend the bottom of the UV coordinate rectangle for each character in pixels |  |
| ExtendBoxRight | int32 | How much to extend the right of the UV coordinate rectangle for each character in pixels |  |
| ExtendBoxLeft | int32 | How much to extend the left of the UV coordinate rectangle for each character in pixels |  |
| bEnableLegacyMode | uint32 | Enables legacy font import mode.  This results in lower quality antialiasing and larger glyph bounds, but may be useful when debugging problems |  |
| Kerning | int32 | The initial horizontal spacing adjustment between rendered characters.  This setting will be copied directly into the generated Font object's properties. |  |
| bUseDistanceFieldAlpha | uint32 | If true then the alpha channel of the font textures will store a distance field instead of a color mask |  |
| DistanceFieldScaleFactor | int32 | Scale factor determines how big to scale the font bitmap during import when generating distance field values <br>	 Note that higher values give better quality but importing will take much longer. |  |
| DistanceFieldScanRadiusScale | float | Shrinks or expands the scan radius used to determine the silhouette of the font edges. |  |
