## Description

Rigid body error correction data

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PingExtrapolation | float | Value between 0 and 1 which indicates how much velocity<br>		and ping based correction to use |  |
| PingLimit | float | For the purpose of extrapolation, ping will be clamped to this value |  |
| ErrorPerLinearDifference | float | Error per centimeter |  |
| ErrorPerAngularDifference | float | Error per degree |  |
| MaxRestoredStateError | float | Maximum allowable error for a state to be considered "resolved" |  |
| MaxLinearHardSnapDistance | float |  |  |
| PositionLerp | float | How much to directly lerp to the correct position. Generally<br>		increase precision along with jerkiness. |  |
| AngleLerp | float | How much to directly lerp to the correct angle. |  |
| LinearVelocityCoefficient | float | This is the coefficient `k` in the differential equation:<br>		the velocity in a replication step. |  |
| AngularVelocityCoefficient | float | This is the angular analog to LinearVelocityCoefficient. |  |
| ErrorAccumulationSeconds | float | Number of seconds to remain in a heuristically<br>		unresolveable state before hard snapping. |  |
| ErrorAccumulationDistanceSq | float | If the body has moved less than the square root of<br>		frame, then error may accumulate towards a hard snap. |  |
| ErrorAccumulationSimilarity | float | If the previous error projected onto the current error<br>		hard snap. |  |
