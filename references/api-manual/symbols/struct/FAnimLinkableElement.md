## Description

Used to describe an element that can be linked to a segment in a montage or sequence.
 	Usage: 
 		Inherit from FAnimLinkableElement and make sure to call LinkMontage or LinkSequence
 		both on creation and on loading the element. From there SetTime and GetTime should be
 		used to control where this element is in the montage or sequence.
 	
 		For more advanced usage, see this implementation used in FAnimNotifyEvent where
 		we have a secondary link to handle a duration
 		@see FAnimNotifyEvent

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedMontage | UAnimMontage * | The montage that this element is currently linked to |  |
| SlotIndex | int32 | The slot index we are currently using within LinkedMontage |  |
| SegmentIndex | int32 | The index of the segment we are linked to within the slot we are using |  |
| LinkMethod | TEnumAsByte < EAnimLinkMethod :: Type > | The method we are using to calculate our times |  |
| CachedLinkMethod | TEnumAsByte < EAnimLinkMethod :: Type > | Cached link method used to transform the time when LinkMethod changes, always relates to the currently stored time |  |
| SegmentBeginTime | float | The absolute time in the montage that our currently linked segment begins |  |
| SegmentLength | float | The absolute length of our currently linked segment |  |
| LinkValue | float | The time of this montage. This will differ depending upon the method we are using to link the time for this element |  |
| LinkedSequence | UAnimSequenceBase * | The Animation Sequence that this montage element will link to, when the sequence changes<br>	  in either length or rate; the element will correctly place itself in relation to the sequence |  |
