## Description

A struct to serve as a filter for Asset Registry queries. Each component element is processed as an 'OR' operation while all the components are processed together as an 'AND' operation.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PackageNames | TArray < FName > | The filter component for package names |  |
| PackagePaths | TArray < FName > | The filter component for package paths |  |
| ObjectPaths | TArray < FName > | The filter component containing specific object paths |  |
| FolderPaths | TArray < FName > | The filter component containing specific object paths |  |
| ClassNames | TArray < FName > | The filter component for class names. Instances of the specified classes, but not subclasses (by default), will be included. Derived classes will be included only if bRecursiveClasses is true. |  |
| RecursiveClassesExclusionSet | TSet < FName > | Only if bRecursiveClasses is true, the results will exclude classes (and subclasses) in this list |  |
| bRecursivePaths | bool | If true, PackagePath components will be recursive |  |
| bRecursiveClasses | bool | If true, subclasses of ClassNames will also be included and RecursiveClassesExclusionSet will be excluded. |  |
| bIncludeOnlyOnDiskAssets | bool | If true, only on-disk assets will be returned. Be warned that this is rarely what you want and should only be used for performance reasons |  |
