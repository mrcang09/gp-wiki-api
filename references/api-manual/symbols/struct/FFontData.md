## Description

Payload data describing an individual font in a typeface. Keep this lean as it's also used as a key!

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FontFilename | FString | The filename of the font to use.<br>	  This variable is ignored if we have a font face asset, and is set to the .ufont file in a cooked build. |  |
| Hinting | EFontHinting | The hinting algorithm to use with the font.<br>	  This variable is ignored if we have a font face asset, and is synchronized with the font face asset on load in a cooked build. |  |
| LoadingPolicy | EFontLoadingPolicy | Enum controlling how this font should be loaded at runtime. See the enum for more explanations of the options.<br>	  This variable is ignored if we have a font face asset, and is synchronized with the font face asset on load in a cooked build. |  |
| FontFaceAsset | UObject * | Font data v3. This points to a font face asset. |  |
| BulkDataPtr_DEPRECATED | UFontBulkData * | Legacy font data v2. This used to be where font data was stored prior to font face assets. <br>	  This can be removed once we no longer support loading packages older than FEditorObjectVersion::AddedFontFaceAssets (as can UFontBulkData itself). |  |
| FontData_DEPRECATED | TArray < uint8 > | Legacy font data v1. This used to be where font data was stored prior to font bulk data.<br>	  This can be removed once we no longer support loading packages older than VER_UE4_SLATE_BULK_FONT_DATA. |  |
