## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ScreenSize | int32 | Screen size of the resulting proxy mesh in pixels |  |
| MaterialSettings | FMaterialProxySettings | Material simplification |  |
| TextureWidth_DEPRECATED | int32 |  |  |
| TextureHeight_DEPRECATED | int32 |  |  |
| bExportNormalMap_DEPRECATED | bool |  |  |
| bExportMetallicMap_DEPRECATED | bool |  |  |
| bExportRoughnessMap_DEPRECATED | bool |  |  |
| bExportSpecularMap_DEPRECATED | bool |  |  |
| bCalculateCorrectLODModel | bool | Determines whether or not the correct LOD models should be calculated given the source meshes and transition size |  |
| MergeDistance | float | Distance at which meshes should be merged together, this can close gaps like doors and windows in distant geometry |  |
| HardAngleThreshold | float | Angle at which a hard edge is introduced between faces |  |
| LightMapResolution | int32 | Lightmap resolution |  |
| bComputeLightMapResolution | bool | If ticked will compute the lightmap resolution by summing the dimensions for each mesh included for merging |  |
| bRecalculateNormals | bool | Whether Simplygon should recalculate normals, otherwise the normals channel will be sampled from the original mesh |  |
| bBakeVertexData_DEPRECATED | bool |  |  |
| bUseLandscapeCulling | bool | Whether or not to use available landscape geometry to cull away invisible triangles |  |
| LandscapeCullingPrecision | TEnumAsByte < ELandscapeCullingPrecision :: Type > | Level of detail of the landscape that should be used for the culling |  |
| bAssignLODGroup | bool | Choose whether you want to apply LODs to the generated mesh or not. |  |
| LODGroupIndex | int32 |  |  |
| bAggregateMeshes | bool |  |  |
| AggregatorMode | EChartAggregationMode |  |  |
| bUseCustomHemisphere | bool |  |  |
| bUseTargetTriangleNumber | bool |  |  |
| TargetTriangleNumber | int32 |  |  |
| LODSelectionType | EMeshLODSelectionType |  |  |
| SpecificLOD | int32 |  |  |
| bIncludeHISMMesh | bool |  |  |
| bHalfVoxelSize | bool |  |  |
| ExpectedQualityLimit | FExpectedQuality | Render quality control for certain devicesplatforms, if limit > actual, primitive won't be rendered. |  |
| bOverrideVoxelSize | uint8 | If true, Spatial Sampling Distance will not be automatically computed based on geometry and you must set it directly |  |
| VoxelSize | float | Override when converting multiple meshes for proxy LOD merging. Warning, large geometry with small sampling has very high memory costs |  |
| UnresolvedGeometryColor | FColor | Base color assigned to LOD geometry that can't be associated with the source geometry: e.g. doors and windows that have been closed by the Merge Distance |  |
| bOverrideTransferDistance | bool | Enable an override for material transfer distance |  |
| MaxRayCastDist | float | Override search distance used when discovering texture values for simplified geometry. Useful when non-zero Merge Distance setting generates new geometry in concave corners. |  |
| bUseHardAngleThreshold | bool | Enable the use of hard angle based vertex splitting |  |
| NormalCalculationMethod | TEnumAsByte < EProxyNormalComputationMethod :: Type > | Controls the method used to calculate the normal for the simplified geometry |  |
| bAllowAdjacency | bool | Whether to allow adjacency buffers for tessellation in the merged mesh |  |
| bAllowDistanceField | bool | Whether to allow distance field to be computed for this mesh. Disable this to save memory if the merged mesh will only be rendered in the distance. |  |
| bReuseMeshLightmapUVs | bool | Whether to attempt to re-use the source mesh's lightmap UVs when baking the material or always generate a new set. |  |
| bCreateCollision | bool | Whether to generate collision for the merged mesh |  |
| bAllowVertexColors | bool | Whether to allow vertex colors saved in the merged mesh |  |
| bGenerateLightmapUVs | bool | Whether to generate lightmap uvs for the merged mesh |  |
