## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LinearDampingOverride | float | Overridden linear damping value. The default is 0.7. Values below 0.7 won't have an effect. |  |
| AngularDampingOverride | float | Overridden angular damping value. The default is 0.7. Values below 0.7 won't have an effect. |  |
| RelativeSpaceBone | FBoneReference | When in BoneRelative sim space, the simulation will use this bone as the origin |  |
| BoundBone | FBoneReference | The bone to attach the physics body to, if bChain is true this is the top of the chain |  |
| ChainEnd | FBoneReference | If bChain is true this is the bottom of the chain, otherwise ignored |  |
| PhysicsBodyDefinitions | TArray < FAnimPhysBodyDefinition_UE5 > |  |  |
| GravityScale | float | Scale for gravity, higher values increase forces due to gravity |  |
| GravityOverride | FVector | Gravity Override Value |  |
| LinearSpringConstant | float | Spring constant to use when calculating linear springs, higher values mean a stronger spring.<br>	  You need to enable the Linear Spring checkbox for this to have an effect. |  |
| AngularSpringConstant | float | Spring constant to use when calculating angular springs, higher values mean a stronger spring.<br>	  You need to enable the Angular Spring checkbox for this to have an effect.<br>	  Note: Make sure to also set the Angular Target Axis and Angular Target in the Constraint Setup for this to have an effect. |  |
| WindScale | float | Scale to apply to calculated wind velocities in the solver |  |
| ComponentLinearAccScale | FVector | When using non-world-space sim, this controls how much of the components world-space acceleration is passed on to the local-space simulation. |  |
| ComponentLinearVelScale | FVector | When using non-world-space sim, this applies a 'drag' to the bodies in the local space simulation, based on the components world-space velocity. |  |
| ComponentAppliedLinearAccClamp | FVector | When using non-world-space sim, this is an overall clamp on acceleration derived from ComponentLinearAccScale and ComponentLinearVelScale, to ensure it is not too large. |  |
| AngularBiasOverride | float | Overridden angular bias value<br>	   Angular bias is essentially a twist reduction for chain forces and defaults to a value to keep chains stability<br>	  in check. When using single-body systems sometimes angular forces will look like they are "catching-up" with<br>	  the mesh, if that's the case override this and push it towards 1.0f until it settles correctly |  |
| NumSolverIterationsPreUpdate | int32 | Number of update passes on the linear and angular limits before we solve the position of the bodies recommended to be four times the value of NumSolverIterationsPostUpdate |  |
| NumSolverIterationsPostUpdate | int32 | Number of update passes on the linear and angular limits after we solve the position of the bodies, recommended to be around a quarter of NumSolverIterationsPreUpdate |  |
| SphericalLimits | TArray < FAnimPhysSphericalLimit_UE5 > | List of available spherical limits for this node |  |
| ExternalForce | FVector | An external force to apply to all bodies in the simulation when ticked, specified in world space |  |
| PlanarLimits | TArray < FAnimPhysPlanarLimit_UE5 > | List of available planar limits for this node |  |
| SimulationSpace | AnimPhysSimSpaceType_UE5 | The space used to run the simulation |  |
| bUseSphericalLimits | uint8 | Whether to evaluate spherical limits |  |
| bUsePlanarLimit | uint8 | Whether to evaluate planar limits |  |
| bDoUpdate | uint8 | If true we will perform physics update, otherwise skip - allows visualization of the initial state of the bodies |  |
| bDoEval | uint8 | If true we will perform bone transform evaluation, otherwise skip - allows visualization of the initial anim state compared to the physics sim |  |
| bOverrideLinearDamping | uint8 | If true, the override value will be used for linear damping |  |
| bOverrideAngularBias | uint8 | If true, the override value will be used for the angular bias for bodies in this node. <br>	   Angular bias is essentially a twist reduction for chain forces and defaults to a value to keep chains stability<br>	   in check. When using single-body systems sometimes angular forces will look like they are "catching-up" with<br>	   the mesh, if that's the case override this and push it towards 1.0f until it settles correctly |  |
| bOverrideAngularDamping | uint8 | If true, the override value will be used for angular damping |  |
| bEnableWind | uint8 | Whether or not wind is enabled for the bodies in this simulation |  |
| bUseGravityOverride | uint8 | Use gravity override value vs gravity scale |  |
| bGravityOverrideInSimSpace | uint8 | If true the gravity override value is defined in simulation space, by default it is in world space |  |
| bLinearSpring | uint8 | If true the body will attempt to spring back to its initial position |  |
| bAngularSpring | uint8 | If true the body will attempt to align itself with the specified angular target |  |
| bChain | uint8 | Set to true to use the solver to simulate a connected chain |  |
