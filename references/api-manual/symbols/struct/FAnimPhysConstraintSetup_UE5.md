## Description

Constraint setup struct, holds data required to build a physics constraint

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LinearXLimitType | AnimPhysLinearConstraintType_UE5 | Whether to limit the linear X axis |  |
| LinearYLimitType | AnimPhysLinearConstraintType_UE5 | Whether to limit the linear Y axis |  |
| LinearZLimitType | AnimPhysLinearConstraintType_UE5 | Whether to limit the linear Z axis |  |
| LinearAxesMin | FVector | Minimum linear movement per-axis (Set zero here and in the max limit to lock) |  |
| LinearAxesMax | FVector | Maximum linear movement per-axis (Set zero here and in the min limit to lock) |  |
| AngularConstraintType | AnimPhysAngularConstraintType_UE5 | Method to use when constraining angular motion |  |
| TwistAxis | AnimPhysTwistAxis | Axis to consider for twist when constraining angular motion (forward axis) |  |
| AngularTargetAxis | AnimPhysTwistAxis | The axis in the simulation pose to align to the Angular Target.<br>	  This is typically the axis pointing along the bone.<br>	  Note: This is affected by the Angular Spring Constant. |  |
| ConeAngle | float | Angle to use when constraining using a cone |  |
| AngularLimitsMin | FVector |  |  |
| AngularLimitsMax | FVector |  |  |
| AngularTarget | FVector | The axis to align the angular spring constraint to in the animation pose.<br>	  This typically points down the bone - so values of (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) are common,<br>	  but you can pick other values to align the spring to a different direction.<br>	  Note: This is affected by the Angular Spring Constant. |  |
| AngularXAngle_DEPRECATED | float | X-axis limit for angular motion when using the "Angular" constraint type (Set to 0 to lock, or 180 to remain free) |  |
| AngularYAngle_DEPRECATED | float | Y-axis limit for angular motion when using the "Angular" constraint type (Set to 0 to lock, or 180 to remain free) |  |
| AngularZAngle_DEPRECATED | float | Z-axis limit for angular motion when using the "Angular" constraint type (Set to 0 to lock, or 180 to remain free) |  |
