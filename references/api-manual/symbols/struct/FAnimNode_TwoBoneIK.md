## Description

Simple 2 Bone IK Controller.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IKBone | FBoneReference | Name of bone to control. This is the main bone chain to modify from. |  |
| bAllowStretching | uint32 | Should stretching be allowed, to be prevent over extension |  |
| StartStretchRatio | float | Limits to use if stretching is allowed. This value determines when to start stretch. For example, 0.9 means once it reaches 90% of the whole length of the limb, it will start apply. |  |
| MaxStretchScale | float | Limits to use if stretching is allowed. This value determins what is the max stretch scale. For example, 1.5 means it will stretch until 150 % of the whole length of the limb. |  |
| StretchLimits_DEPRECATED | FVector2D | Limits to use if stretching is allowed - old property DEPRECATED |  |
| bTakeRotationFromEffectorSpace | uint32 | Set end bone to use End Effector rotation |  |
| bMaintainEffectorRelRot | uint32 | Keep local rotation of end bone |  |
| EffectorLocationSpace | TEnumAsByte < enum EBoneControlSpace > | Reference frame of Effector Location. |  |
| EffectorSpaceBoneName_DEPRECATED | FName | If EffectorLocationSpace is a bone, this is the bone to use. |  |
| EffectorLocation | FVector | Effector Location. Target Location to reach. |  |
| EffectorTarget | FBoneSocketTarget |  |  |
| JointTargetLocationSpace | TEnumAsByte < enum EBoneControlSpace > | Reference frame of Joint Target Location. |  |
| JointTargetLocation | FVector | Joint Target Location. Location used to orient Joint bone. |  |
| JointTargetSpaceBoneName_DEPRECATED | FName | If JointTargetSpaceBoneName is a bone, this is the bone to use. |  |
| JointTarget | FBoneSocketTarget |  |  |
| bAllowTwist | bool | Whether or not to apply twist on the chain of joints. This clears the twist value along the TwistAxis |  |
| TwistAxis | FAxis | Specify which axis it's aligned. Used when removing twist |  |
| bNoTwist_DEPRECATED | bool | Whether or not to apply twist on the chain of joints. This clears the twist value along the TwistAxis |  |
