## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bUseLazyChange | bool |  |  |
| LazyChangeInterval | float |  |  |
| LazyChangeCurve | UCurveFloat * |  |  |
| bLazySimulate_Location | bool |  |  |
| bLazySimulate_Location_OnlyRoot | bool |  |  |
| LazySimulateAlpha_Location | float |  |  |
| bLazySimulate_Rotation | bool |  |  |
| bLazySimulate_Rotation_OnlyRoot | bool |  |  |
| LazySimulateAlpha_Rotation | float |  |  |
| SimulationSpace | AnimPhysSimSpaceType | The space used to run the simulation |  |
| RelativeSpaceBone | FBoneReference | When in BoneRelative sim space, the simulation will use this bone as the origin |  |
| bChain | bool | Set to true to use the solver to simulate a connected chain |  |
| BoundBone | FBoneReference | The bone to attach the physics body to, if bChain is true this is the top of the chain |  |
| ChainEnd | FBoneReference | If bChain is true this is the bottom of the chain, otherwise ignored |  |
| BoxExtents | FVector | Extents of the box to use for simulation |  |
| LocalJointOffset | FVector | Vector relative to the body being simulated to attach the constraint to |  |
| OldLocalJointOffset | FVector |  |  |
| GravityScale | float | Scale for gravity, higher values increase forces due to gravity |  |
| bLinearSpring | bool | If true the body will attempt to spring back to its initial position |  |
| bAngularSpring | bool | If true the body will attempt to align itself with the specified angular target |  |
| LinearSpringConstant | float | Spring constant to use when calculating linear springs, higher values mean a stronger spring. |  |
| AngularSpringConstant | float | Spring constant to use when calculating angular springs, higher values mean a stronger spring |  |
| bEnableWind | bool | Whether or not wind is enabled for the bodies in this simulation |  |
| bWindWasEnabled | bool |  |  |
| WindScale | float | Scale to apply to calculated wind velocities in the solver |  |
| bOverrideLinearDamping | bool | If true, the override value will be used for linear damping |  |
| LinearDampingOverride | float | Overridden linear damping value |  |
| bOverrideAngularDamping | bool | If true, the override value will be used for angular damping |  |
| AngularDampingOverride | float | Overridden angular damping value |  |
| bOverrideAngularBias | bool | If true, the override value will be used for the angular bias for bodies in this node. <br>	   Angular bias is essentially a twist reduction for chain forces and defaults to a value to keep chains stability<br>	   in check. When using single-body systems sometimes angular forces will look like they are "catching-up" with<br>	   the mesh, if that's the case override this and push it towards 1.0f until it settles correctly |  |
| AngularBiasOverride | float | Overridden angular bias value<br>	   Angular bias is essentially a twist reduction for chain forces and defaults to a value to keep chains stability<br>	   in check. When using single-body systems sometimes angular forces will look like they are "catching-up" with<br>	   the mesh, if that's the case override this and push it towards 1.0f until it settles correctly |  |
| bDoUpdate | bool | If true we will perform physics update, otherwise skip - allows visualisation of the initial state of the bodies |  |
| bDoEval | bool | If true we will perform bone transform evaluation, otherwise skip - allows visualisation of the initial anim state compared to the physics sim |  |
| NumSolverIterationsPreUpdate | int32 | Number of update passes on the linear and angular limits before we solve the position of the bodies recommended to be four times the value of NumSolverIterationsPostUpdate |  |
| NumSolverIterationsPostUpdate | int32 | Number of update passes on the linear and angular limits after we solve the position of the bodies, recommended to be around a quarter of NumSolverIterationsPreUpdate |  |
| ConstraintSetup | FAnimPhysConstraintSetup | Data describing the constraints we will apply to the body |  |
| bUseDynamicAngularLimits | bool | if set, will use Dynamic_AngularLimits as ConstraintSetup.AngularLimits when UpdateLimits |  |
| Dynamic_AngularLimitsMin | FVector | if bUseDynamicAngularLimits set, will use Dynamic_AngularLimitsMin as ConstraintSetup.AngularLimitsMin when UpdateLimits |  |
| Dynamic_AngularLimitsMax | FVector | if bUseDynamicAngularLimits set, will use Dynamic_AngularLimitsMax as ConstraintSetup.AngularLimitsMax when UpdateLimits |  |
| bUsePlanarLimit | bool | Whether to evaluate planar limits |  |
| PlanarLimits | TArray < FAnimPhysPlanarLimit > | List of available planar limits for this node |  |
| bUseSphericalLimits | bool | Whether to evaluate spherical limits |  |
| SphericalLimits | TArray < FAnimPhysSphericalLimit > | List of available spherical limits for this node |  |
| CollisionType | AnimPhysCollisionType | Resolution method for planar limits |  |
| SphereCollisionRadius | float | Radius to use if CollisionType is set to CustomSphere |  |
| NonEvaluateFrameNum | int32 | Non Evaluate frame from start |  |
| ExternalForce | FVector | An external force to apply to all bodies in the simulation when ticked, specified in world space |  |
| BoneShiftTolerenceChecker | FAnimNodeBoneShiftTolerenceChecker | Bone Shift Tolerence Check Start |  |
