## Description

Container for Animation Update Rate parameters.
  They are shared for all components of an Actor, so they can be updated in sync.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UpdateRate | int32 | How often animation will be updatedticked. 1 = every frame, 2 = every 2 frames, etc. |  |
| bShouldUseLodMap | uint32 | Whether or not to use the defined LODFrameskip map instead of separate distance factor thresholds |  |
| EvaluationRate | int32 | How often animation will be evaluated. 1 = every frame, 2 = every 2 frames, etc.<br>	   has to be a multiple of UpdateRate. |  |
| bInterpolateSkippedFrames | uint32 | When skipping a frame, should it be interpolated or frozen? |  |
| bShouldUseMinLod | uint32 | If set, LODFrameskip map will be queried with mesh's MinLodModel instead of current LOD (PredictedLODLevel) |  |
| bSkipUpdate | uint32 | (This frame) animation update should be skipped. |  |
| bSkipEvaluation | uint32 | (This frame) animation evaluation should be skipped. |  |
| TickedPoseOffestTime | float | Track time we have lost via skipping |  |
| AdditionalTime | float | Total time of the last series of skipped updates |  |
| MaxDistFromMainChar | float |  |  |
| BaseNonRenderedUpdateRate | int32 | Rate of animation evaluation when non rendered (off screen and dedicated servers).<br>	  a value of 4 means evaluated 1 frame, then 3 frames skipped |  |
| BaseNonRenderedUpdateRateHigh | int32 |  |  |
| BaseVisibleDistanceFactorThesholds | TArray < float > | Array of MaxDistanceFactor to use for AnimUpdateRate when mesh is visible (rendered).<br>	  MaxDistanceFactor is size on screen, as used by LODs<br>	  Example:<br>	 		BaseVisibleDistanceFactorThesholds.Add(0.4f)<br>	 		BaseVisibleDistanceFactorThesholds.Add(0.2f)<br>	  means:<br>	 		0 frame skip, MaxDistanceFactor > 0.4f<br>	 		1 frame skip, MaxDistanceFactor > 0.2f<br>	 		2 frame skip, MaxDistanceFactor > 0.0f |  |
| BaseVisibleDistanceFactorSkipNum | int32 |  |  |
| MinEvaluationRate | int32 |  |  |
| EnableUROInterpolation | bool |  |  |
| MaxEvalRateForInterpolation | int32 | Max Evaluation Rate allowed for interpolation to be enabled. Beyond, interpolation will be turned off. |  |
| LockAnimUpdateRate | int32 |  |  |
| LODToFrameSkipMap | TMap < int32 , int32 > | Map of LOD levels to frame skip amounts. if bShouldUseLodMap is set these values will be used for<br>	  the frameskip amounts and the distance factor thresholds will be ignored. The flag and these values<br>	  should be configured using the customization callback when parameters are created for a component.<br>	 <br>	  Note that this is # of frames to skip, so if you have 20, that means every 21th frame, it will update, and evaluate. |  |
| ShiftBucket | EUpdateRateShiftBucket | The bucket to use when deciding which counter to use to calculate shift values |  |
