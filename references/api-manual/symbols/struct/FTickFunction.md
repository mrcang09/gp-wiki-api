## Description

Abstract Base class for all tick functions.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TickGroup | TEnumAsByte < enum ETickingGroup > | Defines the minimum tick group for this tick function. These groups determine the relative order of when objects tick during a frame update.<br>	  Given prerequisites, the tick may be delayed.<br>	 <br>	  @see ETickingGroup <br>	  @see FTickFunction::AddPrerequisite() |  |
| EndTickGroup | TEnumAsByte < enum ETickingGroup > | Defines the tick group that this tick function must finish in. These groups determine the relative order of when objects tick during a frame update.<br>	 <br>	  @see ETickingGroup |  |
| bTickEvenWhenPaused | uint8 | Bool indicating that this function should execute even if the game is paused. Pause ticks are very limited in capabilities. |  |
| bCanEverTick | uint8 | If false, this tick function will never be registered and will never tick. Only settable in defaults. |  |
| bStartWithTickEnabled | uint8 | If true, this tick function will start enabled, but can be disabled later on. |  |
| bAllowTickOnDedicatedServer | uint8 | If we allow this tick to run on a dedicated server |  |
| bPureLogicTick | uint8 | Pure logic tick group that is actually tick in game thread,  don't need to queue tick and task graph system |  |
| bAllowDynamicSchedule | uint8 | Whether dynamic scheduling is allowed for this tick function |  |
| TickInterval | float | The frequency in seconds at which this tick function will be executed.  If less than or equal to 0 then it will tick every frame |  |
| TickIntervalStartTime | float | TickInterval Start Time Offset |  |
