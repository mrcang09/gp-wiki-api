## Description

This node uses a source transform of a socket on the skeletal mesh to automatically calculate
  Yaw and Pitch directions for a referenced aim offset given a point in the world to look at.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BasePose | FPoseLink |  |  |
| LODThreshold | int32 | Max LOD that this node is allowed to run<br>	 For example if you have LODThreadhold to be 2, it will run until LOD 2 (based on 0 index)<br>	 when the component LOD becomes 3, it will stop updateevaluate<br>	 currently transition would be issue and that has to be re-visited |  |
| bIsLODEnabled | bool |  |  |
| LookAtLocation | FVector | Location, in world space to look at |  |
| SourceSocketName | FName | Socket to treat as the look at source |  |
| PivotSocketName | FName | Socket to treat as the look at pivot (optional). This will overwrite the translation of the source socket transform to better match the lookat direction |  |
| SocketAxis | FVector | Axis in the socket transform to consider the 'forward' or look at axis |  |
| Alpha | float | Amount of this node to blend into the output pose |  |
| SocketBoneReference | FBoneReference | Cached reference to the source socket's bone |  |
| SocketLocalTransform | FTransform | Cached local transform of the source socket |  |
| PivotSocketBoneReference | FBoneReference | Cached reference to the pivot socket's bone |  |
| PivotSocketLocalTransform | FTransform | Cached local transform of the pivot socket |  |
