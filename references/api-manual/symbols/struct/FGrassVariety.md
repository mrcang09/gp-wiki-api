## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GrassMesh | UStaticMesh * |  |  |
| GrassDensity | float | Instances per 10 square meters. |  |
| bUseGrid | bool | If true, use a jittered grid sequence for placement, otherwise use a halton sequence. |  |
| PlacementJitter | float |  |  |
| StartCullDistance | int32 | The distance where instances will begin to fade out if using a PerInstanceFadeAmount material node. 0 disables. |  |
| EndCullDistance | int32 | The distance where instances will have completely faded out when using a PerInstanceFadeAmount material node. 0 disables. <br>	  When the entire cluster is beyond this distance, the cluster is completely culled and not rendered at all. |  |
| MinLOD | int32 | Specifies the smallest LOD that will be used for this component.<br>	  If -1 (default), the MinLOD of the static mesh asset will be used instead. |  |
| Scaling | EGrassScaling | Specifies grass instance scaling type |  |
| ScaleX | FFloatInterval | Specifies the range of scale, from minimum to maximum, to apply to a grass instance's X Scale property |  |
| ScaleY | FFloatInterval | Specifies the range of scale, from minimum to maximum, to apply to a grass instance's Y Scale property |  |
| ScaleZ | FFloatInterval | Specifies the range of scale, from minimum to maximum, to apply to a grass instance's Z Scale property |  |
| RandomRotation | bool | Whether the grass instances should be placed at random rotation (true) or all at the same rotation (false) |  |
| AlignToSurface | bool | Whether the grass instances should be tilted to the normal of the landscape (true), or always vertical (false) |  |
| bUseLandscapeLightmap | bool | Whether to use the landscape's lightmap when rendering the grass. |  |
| LightingChannels | FLightingChannels | Lighting channels that the grass will be assigned. Lights with matching channels will affect the grass.<br>	  These channels only apply to opaque materials, direct lighting, and dynamic lighting and shadowing. |  |
| bReceivesDecals | bool | Whether the grass instances should receive decals. |  |
