## Description

Settings used to reduce a mesh.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BaseLODModel | int32 | Source Index. The index into source models from which to generate the LOD from |  |
| MetricToUse | EOptimizationMetric | Optimize the mesh based on the following metric option |  |
| PercentTriangles | float | Percentage of triangles to keep. 1.0 = no reduction, 0.0 = no triangles. |  |
| ScreenSize | float |  |  |
| MaxDeviation | float | The maximum distance in object space by which the reduced mesh may deviate from the original mesh. |  |
| PixelError | float | The amount of error in pixels allowed for this LOD. |  |
| WeldingThreshold | float | Threshold in object space at which vertices are welded together. |  |
| SilhouetteImportance | TEnumAsByte < EMeshFeatureImportance :: Type > | Higher values minimize change to border edges. |  |
| TextureImportance | TEnumAsByte < EMeshFeatureImportance :: Type > | Higher values reduce texture stretching. |  |
| ShadingImportance | TEnumAsByte < EMeshFeatureImportance :: Type > | Higher values try to preserve normals better. |  |
| VertexColorImportance | TEnumAsByte < EMeshFeatureImportance :: Type > | Higher values minimize change to vertex color data. |  |
| bRecalculateNormals | bool |  |  |
| HardAngleThreshold | float | Angle at which a hard edge is introduced between faces. |  |
| bActive_DEPRECATED | bool |  |  |
| bGenerateUniqueLightmapUVs | bool |  |  |
| bKeepSymmetry | bool |  |  |
| bVisibilityAided | bool |  |  |
| bCullOccluded | bool |  |  |
| VisibilityAggressiveness | TEnumAsByte < EMeshFeatureImportance :: Type > | Higher values generates fewer samples |  |
| bUseVertexWeights | bool | Vertex colors are converted to weights. The weights are used<br>	- Red: Vertices will be less important |  |
| bSimplifyMaterials | bool | The following will create a material proxy |  |
| MaterialLODSettings_DEPRECATED | FSimplygonMaterialLODSettings |  |  |
| MaterialProxySettings | FMaterialProxySettings | Material Proxy for LODs |  |
