## Description

FSkeletalMeshOptimizationSettings - The settings used to optimize a skeletal mesh LOD.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ReductionMethod | TEnumAsByte < enum SkeletalMeshOptimizationType > | The method to use when optimizing the skeletal mesh LOD |  |
| NumOfTrianglesPercentage | float | If ReductionMethod equals SMOT_NumOfTriangles this value is the ratio of triangles [0-1] to remove from the mesh |  |
| MaxDeviationPercentage | float | If ReductionMethod equals SMOT_MaxDeviation this value is the maximum deviation from the base mesh as a percentage of the bounding sphere. |  |
| ScreenSize | int32 | If ReductionMethod equals SMOT_ScreenSize this value is the screen size in pixel at which the LOD should be viewed |  |
| WeldingThreshold | float | The welding threshold distance. Vertices under this distance will be welded. |  |
| bRecalcNormals | bool | Whether Normal smoothing groups should be preserved. If false then NormalsThreshold is used |  |
| NormalsThreshold | float | If the angle between two triangles are above this value, the normals will not be<br>	smooth over the edge between those two triangles. Set in degrees. This is only used when PreserveNormals is set to false |  |
| SilhouetteImportance | TEnumAsByte < enum SkeletalMeshOptimizationImportance > | How important the shape of the geometry is. |  |
| TextureImportance | TEnumAsByte < enum SkeletalMeshOptimizationImportance > | How important texture density is. |  |
| ShadingImportance | TEnumAsByte < enum SkeletalMeshOptimizationImportance > | How important shading quality is. |  |
| SkinningImportance | TEnumAsByte < enum SkeletalMeshOptimizationImportance > | How important skinning quality is. |  |
| BoneReductionRatio | float | The ratio of bones that will be removed from the mesh |  |
| MaxBonesPerVertex | int32 | Maximum number of bones that can be assigned to each vertex. |  |
| bTransferMorphTarget | bool | Specify if morph targets should be transfered to the LOD or not |  |
| BonesToRemove_DEPRECATED | TArray < FBoneReference > |  |  |
| BaseLOD | int32 | Index to which LOD model you want as source when generating the LOD |  |
| LODChainLastIndex | int32 |  |  |
| bUseVertexWeights | bool | Vertex colors are converted to weights. The weights are used<br>	- Red: Vertices will be less important |  |
| bUseVertexWeightsForMaterial | bool |  |  |
| bSimplifyMaterials | bool | Specify if material should be baked or not. |  |
| MaterialLODSettings_DEPRECATED | FSimplygonMaterialLODSettings |  |  |
| MaterialSettings | FMaterialProxySettings |  |  |
| bForceRebuild | bool | This is a transient property used to pass "force build" option from UI to FLODUtilities |  |
| BakePose_DEPRECATED | UAnimSequence * |  |  |
