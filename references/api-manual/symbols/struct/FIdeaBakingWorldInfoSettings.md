## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BakingLayout | EIdeaBakingLayout | By luciuszhang: Baking layout mode |  |
| NumCoarseSamples | int32 | Number of first pass light samples. |  |
| NumSamples | int32 | Number of second pass light samples for two pass mode and samples for brute force mode. |  |
| NumLightingBounces | int32 | Number of light bounces to simulate for point  spot  directional lights, starting from the light source.<br>	 0 is direct lighting only, 1 is one bounce, etc.<br>	 Bounce 1 takes the most time to calculate and contributes the most to visual quality, followed by bounce 2.<br>	 Successive bounces don't really affect build times, but have a much lower visual impact, unless the material diffuse colors are close to 1. |  |
| LightmapBoost | float | Scales the lightmap result of idea baking. |  |
| SunHardness | float | Control Sun direction falloff, bigger SunHardness, three direction will be more separated |  |
| BakingMode | EIdeaBakingMode | Baking path tracing mode, just for debug |  |
| bUseParallelBaking | uint32 | If true, parallel baking will be enabled. |  |
| bUseConservativeRasterization | uint32 | If true, Conservative Rasterization (emulated by multi-tap) will be enabled. |  |
| bUseLocalOcclusion | uint32 | If true, local ambient occlusion (A0) will be enabled. |  |
| LocalOcclusionRadius | float | Local ambient occlusion(A0) tracing radius. |  |
| LocalOcclusionFallOff | float | Local ambient occlusion(A0) transition speed. |  |
| LocalOcclusionDistribution | float | Local ambient occlusion(A0) sampling distribution. |  |
| LocalOcclusionFadeRatio | float | Local ambient occlusion(A0) fade start ratio. |  |
| LocalOcclusionRes | int32 | Local ambient occlusion(A0) resolution multiple. |  |
| LocalOcclusionMultiple | int32 | Local ambient occlusion(A0) sampling multiple. |  |
| LocalOcclusionPower | float | Local ambient occlusion(A0) strength, larger value, darker AO. |  |
| LocalOcclusionDenoising | int32 | Local ambient occlusion(A0) denoising filter count. |  |
| LocalOcclusionDilation | int32 | Local ambient occlusion(A0) dilation filter count. |  |
| NumDenoisingIterators | int32 | If true, denoise filter will be enabled. |  |
| NumDilationIterators | int32 | If true, dilation filter will be enabled. |  |
| DirectLightDenoising | int32 | Denoising filter iteration number for direct lighting. |  |
| RayTraceMaxDistance | float | By luciuszhang: Path tracing distance threshold in centimeters. |  |
| RayTraceBias | float | By luciuszhang: Path tracing ray bias in centimeters. |  |
| RetraceDistance | float | By luciuszhang: Retrace distance threshold in centimeters. |  |
| SmallestTexelRadius | float | By luciuszhang:<br>	 Smallest texel radius allowed, useful for clamping edge cases where some texels have a radius of 0.<br>	 This should be smaller than the smallest valid texel radius in the scene. |  |
| AreaLightSampleCount | uint32 | Path tracing distance threshold in centimeters. |  |
| bWithPortalDirectLighting | uint32 | If true, calculate portal light direct lighting. |  |
| bWithGrayDiffuse | uint32 | If true, use gray diffuse material for sun indirect lighting. |  |
