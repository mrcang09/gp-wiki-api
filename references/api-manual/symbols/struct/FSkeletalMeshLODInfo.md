## Description

Struct containing information for a particular LOD level, such as materials and info for when to use it.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ScreenSize | float | ScreenSize to display this LOD.<br>	  The screen size is based around the projected diameter of the bounding<br>	  sphere of the model. i.e. 0.5 means half the screen's maximum dimension. |  |
| LODHysteresis | float | Used to avoid 'flickering' when on LOD boundary. Only taken into account when moving from complex->simple. |  |
| LODMaterialMap | TArray < int32 > | Mapping table from this LOD's materials to the USkeletalMesh materials array. |  |
| UVOffsets | TArray < FVector4 > |  |  |
| bEnableShadowCasting_DEPRECATED | TArray < bool > | Per-section control over whether to enable shadow casting. |  |
| TriangleSortSettings | TArray < FTriangleSortSettings > |  |  |
| bHasBeenSimplified | uint32 | Whether to disable morph targets for this LOD. |  |
| ReductionSettings | FSkeletalMeshOptimizationSettings | Reduction settings to apply when building render data. |  |
| RemeshingSettings_DEPRECATED | FSimplygonRemeshingSettings | Remeshing settings to apply when building render data. |  |
| OptimizationSettings | FGroupedSkeletalOptimizationSettings |  |  |
| RemovedBones_DEPRECATED | TArray < FName > | This has been removed in editor. We could re-apply this in import time or by mesh reduction utilities |  |
| BonesToRemove | TArray < FBoneReference > | Bones which should be removed from the skeleton for the LOD level |  |
| BakePose | UAnimSequence * | Pose which should be used to reskin vertex influences for which the bones will be removed in this LOD level, uses ref-pose by default |  |
| SourceImportFilename | FString | The filename of the file tha was used to import this LOD if it was not auto generated. |  |
| bHasPerLODVertexColors | uint32 |  |  |
