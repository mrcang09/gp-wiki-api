## Description

Properties from the base material that can be overridden in material instances.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bOverride_OpacityMaskClipValue | bool | Enables override of the opacity mask clip value. |  |
| bOverride_BlendMode | bool | Enables override of the blend mode. |  |
| bOverride_ShadingModel | bool | Enables override of the shading model. |  |
| bOverride_DitheredLODTransition | bool | Enables override of the dithered LOD transition property. |  |
| bOverride_ForceOpaqueLevelPointIndirectLighting | bool |  |  |
| bOverride_CastDynamicShadowAsMasked | bool | Enables override of whether to shadow using masked opacity on translucent materials. |  |
| bOverride_TwoSided | bool | Enables override of the two sided property. |  |
| bOverride_UsedWithTranslucentGI | bool | [SurfelGI - brainfkli ADD]<br>	  Indicates that the material and its instances can be affected by GI in translucent blend mode. |  |
| bOverride_ShadingRate | bool | Enables override of the shading rate. |  |
| OpacityMaskClipValue | float | If BlendMode is BLEND_Masked, the surface is not rendered where OpacityMask < OpacityMaskClipValue. |  |
| BlendMode | TEnumAsByte < EBlendMode > | The blend mode |  |
| ShadingModel | TEnumAsByte < EMaterialShadingModel > | The shading model |  |
| TwoSided | uint32 | Indicates that the material should be rendered without backface culling and the normal should be flipped for backfaces. |  |
| DitheredLODTransition | uint32 | Whether the material should support a dithered LOD transition when used with the foliage system. |  |
| ForceOpaqueLevelPointIndirectLighting | uint32 |  |  |
| bCastDynamicShadowAsMasked | uint32 | Whether the material should cast shadows as masked even though it has a translucent blend mode. |  |
| bUsedWithTranslucentGI | uint32 | [SurfelGI - brainfkli ADD]<br>	  Indicates that the material and its instances can be affected by GI in translucent blend mode. |  |
| ShadingRate | TEnumAsByte < EMaterialShadingRate > | The shading rate |  |
