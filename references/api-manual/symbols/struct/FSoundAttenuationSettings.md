## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bAttenuate | uint32 | Allows distance-based volume attenuation. |  |
| bSpatialize | uint32 | Allows the source to be 3D spatialized. |  |
| bAttenuateWithLPF | uint32 | Allows simulation of air absorption by applying a filter with a cutoff frequency as a function of distance. |  |
| bEnableListenerFocus | uint32 | Enable listener focus-based adjustments. |  |
| bEnableFocusInterpolation | uint32 | Enables focus interpolation to smooth transition in and and of focus. |  |
| bEnableOcclusion | uint32 | Enables realtime occlusion tracing. |  |
| bUseComplexCollisionForOcclusion | uint32 | Enables tracing against complex collision when doing occlusion traces. |  |
| bEnableReverbSend | uint32 | Enables adjusting reverb sends based on distance. |  |
| bApplyNormalizationToStereoSounds | uint32 | Enables applying a -6 dB attenuation to stereo assets which are 3d spatialized. Avoids clipping when assets have spread of 0.0 due to channel summing. |  |
| bEnableLogFrequencyScaling | uint32 | Enables applying a log scale to frequency values (so frequency sweeping is perceptually linear). |  |
| DistanceType_DEPRECATED | TEnumAsByte < enum ESoundDistanceCalc > |  |  |
| OmniRadius | float | The distance below which a sound is non-spatialized (2D). This prevents near-field audio from flipping as audio crosses the listener's position. |  |
| StereoSpread | float | The world-space absolution distance between left and right stereo channels when stereo assets are 3D spatialized. |  |
| SpatializationAlgorithm | TEnumAsByte < enum ESoundSpatializationAlgorithm > | What method we use to spatialize the sound. |  |
| SpatializationPluginSettings | USpatializationPluginSourceSettingsBase * | Settings to use with occlusion audio plugin. These are defined by the plugin creator. Not all audio plugins utilize this feature. |  |
| RadiusMin_DEPRECATED | float |  |  |
| RadiusMax_DEPRECATED | float |  |  |
| LPFRadiusMin | float | The distance min range at which to apply an absorption LPF filter. |  |
| LPFRadiusMax | float | The max distance range at which to apply an absorption LPF filter. Absorption freq cutoff interpolates between filter frequency ranges between these distance values. |  |
| AbsorptionMethod | EAirAbsorptionMethod | What method to use to map distance values to frequency absorption values. |  |
| CustomLowpassAirAbsorptionCurve | FRuntimeFloatCurve | The normalized custom curve to use for the air absorption lowpass frequency values. Does a mapping from defined distance values (x-axis) and defined frequency values (y-axis) |  |
| CustomHighpassAirAbsorptionCurve | FRuntimeFloatCurve | The normalized custom curve to use for the air absorption highpass frequency values. Does a mapping from defined distance values (x-axis) and defined frequency values (y-axis) |  |
| LPFFrequencyAtMin | float | The range of the cutoff frequency (in hz) of the lowpass absorption filter. |  |
| LPFFrequencyAtMax | float | The range of the cutoff frequency (in hz) of the lowpass absorption filter. |  |
| HPFFrequencyAtMin | float | The range of the cutoff frequency (in hz) of the highpass absorption filter. |  |
| HPFFrequencyAtMax | float | The range of the cutoff frequency (in hz) of the highpass absorption filter. |  |
| FocusAzimuth | float | Azimuth angle (in degrees) relative to the listener forward vector which defines the focus region of sounds. Sounds playing at an angle less than this will be in focus. |  |
| NonFocusAzimuth | float | Azimuth angle (in degrees) relative to the listener forward vector which defines the non-focus region of sounds. Sounds playing at an angle greater than this will be out of focus. |  |
| FocusDistanceScale | float | Amount to scale the distance calculation of sounds that are in-focus. Can be used to make in-focus sounds appear to be closer or further away than they actually are. |  |
| NonFocusDistanceScale | float | Amount to scale the distance calculation of sounds that are not in-focus. Can be used to make in-focus sounds appear to be closer or further away than they actually are. |  |
| FocusPriorityScale | float | Amount to scale the priority of sounds that are in focus. Can be used to boost the priority of sounds that are in focus. |  |
| NonFocusPriorityScale | float | Amount to scale the priority of sounds that are not in-focus. Can be used to reduce the priority of sounds that are not in focus. |  |
| FocusVolumeAttenuation | float | Amount to attenuate sounds that are in focus. Can be overridden at the sound-level. |  |
| NonFocusVolumeAttenuation | float | Amount to attenuate sounds that are not in focus. Can be overridden at the sound-level. |  |
| FocusAttackInterpSpeed | float | Scalar used to increase interpolation speed upwards to the target Focus value |  |
| FocusReleaseInterpSpeed | float | Scalar used to increase interpolation speed downwards to the target Focus value |  |
| OcclusionTraceChannel | TEnumAsByte < enum ECollisionChannel > | Which trace channel to use for audio occlusion checks. |  |
| OcclusionLowPassFilterFrequency | float | The low pass filter frequency (in hertz) to apply if the sound playing in this audio component is occluded. This will override the frequency set in LowPassFilterFrequency. A frequency of 0.0 is the device sample rate and will bypass the filter. |  |
| OcclusionVolumeAttenuation | float | The amount of volume attenuation to apply to sounds which are occluded. |  |
| OcclusionInterpolationTime | float | The amount of time in seconds to interpolate to the target OcclusionLowPassFilterFrequency when a sound is occluded. |  |
| OcclusionPluginSettings | UOcclusionPluginSourceSettingsBase * | Settings to use with occlusion audio plugin. These are defined by the plugin creator. Not all audio plugins utilize this feature. |  |
| ReverbSendMethod | EReverbSendMethod | What method to use to control master reverb sends |  |
| ReverbPluginSettings | UReverbPluginSourceSettingsBase * | Settings to use with reverb audio plugin. These are defined by the plugin creator. Not all audio plugins utilize this feature. |  |
| ReverbWetLevelMin | float | The amount to send to master reverb when sound is located at a distance equal to value specified in the reverb min send distance. |  |
| ReverbWetLevelMax | float | The amount to send to master reverb when sound is located at a distance equal to value specified in the reverb max send distance. |  |
| ReverbDistanceMin | float | The min distance to send to the master reverb. |  |

| CustomReverbSendCurve | FRuntimeFloatCurve | The custom reverb send curve to use for distance-based send level. |  |
| ManualReverbSendLevel | float | The manual master reverb send level to use. Doesn't change as a function of distance. |  |
