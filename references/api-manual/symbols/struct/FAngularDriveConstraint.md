## Description

Angular Drive

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TwistDrive | FConstraintDrive | Controls the twist (roll) constraint drive between current orientationvelocity and target orientationvelocity. This is available as long as the twist limit is set to free or limited. |  |
| SwingDrive | FConstraintDrive | Controls the cone constraint drive between current orientationvelocity and target orientationvelocity. This is available as long as there is at least one swing limit set to free or limited. |  |
| SlerpDrive | FConstraintDrive | Controls the SLERP (spherical lerp) drive between current orientationvelocity and target orientationvelocity. NOTE: This is only available when all three angular limits are either free or limited. Locking any angular limit will turn off the drive implicitly. |  |
| OrientationTarget | FRotator | Target orientation relative to the the body reference frame. |  |
| AngularVelocityTarget | FVector | Target angular velocity relative to the body reference frame. |  |
| AngularDriveMode | TEnumAsByte < enum EAngularDriveMode :: Type > | Whether motors use SLERP (spherical lerp) or decompose into a Swing motor (cone constraints) and Twist motor (roll constraints). NOTE: SLERP will NOT work if any of the angular constraints are locked. |  |
