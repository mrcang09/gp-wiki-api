## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PrimitiveRenderMode | ESceneCapturePrimitiveRenderMode | Controls what primitives get rendered into the scene capture. |  |
| HiddenComponents | TArray < TWeakObjectPtr < UPrimitiveComponent > > | The components won't rendered by current component. |  |
| HiddenActors | TArray < AActor * > | The actors to hide in the scene capture. |  |
| ShowOnlyComponents | TArray < TWeakObjectPtr < UPrimitiveComponent > > | The only components to be rendered by this scene capture, if PrimitiveRenderMode is set to UseShowOnlyList. |  |
| bShowAttachedActor | bool |  |  |
| ShowOnlyActors | TArray < AActor * > | The only actors to be rendered by this scene capture, if PrimitiveRenderMode is set to UseShowOnlyList. |  |
| bCaptureEveryFrame | bool | Whether to update the capture's contents every frame.  If disabled, the component will render once on load and then only when moved. |  |
| bCaptureOnMovement | bool | Whether to update the capture's contents on movement.  Disable if you are going to capture manually from blueprint. |  |
| bAlwaysPersistRenderingState | bool | Whether to persist the rendering state even if bCaptureEveryFrame==false.  This allows velocities for Motion Blur and Temporal AA to be computed. |  |
| LODDistanceFactor | float | Scales the distance used by LOD. Set to values greater than 1 to cause the scene capture to use lower LODs than the main view to speed up the scene capture pass. |  |
| MaxViewDistanceOverride | float | if > 0, sets a maximum render distance override.  Can be used to cull distant objects from a reflection if the reflecting plane is in an enclosed area like a hallway or room |  |
| CaptureSortPriority | int32 | Capture priority within the frame to sort scene capture on GPU to resolve interdependencies between multiple capture components. Highest come first. |  |
| ShowFlagSettings | TArray < struct FEngineShowFlagsSetting > | ShowFlags for the SceneCapture's ViewFamily, to control rendering settings for this view. Hidden but accessible through details customization |  |
| LightingChannels | FLightingChannels |  |  |
| bUseLightingChannels | bool |  |  |
