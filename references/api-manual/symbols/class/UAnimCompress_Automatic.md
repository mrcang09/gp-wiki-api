## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MaxEndEffectorError | float | Maximum amount of error that a compression technique can introduce in an end effector <br>	 Determines the current setting for world - space error tolerance in the animation compressor.<br>	 When requested, animation being compressed will also consider an alternative compression<br>	 method if the end result of that method produces less error than the AlternativeCompressionThreshold.<br>	 Also known as "Alternative Compression Threshold" |  |
| bTryFixedBitwiseCompression | uint32 | If true, the uniform bitwise techniques will be tried |  |
| bTryPerTrackBitwiseCompression | uint32 | If true, the per-track compressor techniques will be tried |  |
| bTryLinearKeyRemovalCompression | uint32 | If true, the linear key removal techniques will be tried |  |
| bTryIntervalKeyRemoval | uint32 | If true, the resampling techniques will be tried |  |
| bRunCurrentDefaultCompressor | uint32 | If true, then the animation will be first recompressed with it's current compressor if non-NULL, or with the global default compressor (specified in the engine ini)<br>	 Also known as "First Recompress Using Current Or Default" |  |
| bAutoReplaceIfExistingErrorTooGreat | uint32 | If true and the existing compression error is greater than Max End Effector Error, then any compression technique (even one that increases the size) with a lower error will be used until it falls below the threshold<br>	 Also known as "force below threshold" |  |
| bRaiseMaxErrorToExisting | uint32 | If true and the existing compression error is greater than Max End Effector Error, then Max End Effector Error will be effectively raised to the existing error level |  |
| bTryPerTrackVarBitCompression | uint32 | If true, the per-track variable bit compressor techniques will be tried |  |
