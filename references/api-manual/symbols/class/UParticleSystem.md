## Description

A ParticleSystem is a complete particle effect that contains any number of ParticleEmitters. By allowing multiple emitters
  in a system, the designer can create elaborate particle effects that are held in a single system. Once created using
  Cascade, a ParticleSystem can then be inserted into a level or created in script.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SystemUpdateMode | TEnumAsByte < enum EParticleSystemUpdateMode > |  |  |
| UpdateTime_FPS | float | UpdateTime_FPS	- the frame per second to update at in FixedTime mode |  |
| UpdateTime_Delta | float | UpdateTime_Delta	- internal |  |
| WarmupTime | float | WarmupTime - the time to warm-up the particle system when first rendered	<br>	  Warning: WarmupTime is implemented by simulating the particle system for the time requested upon activation.  <br>	  This is extremely prone to cause hitches, especially with large particle counts - use with caution. |  |
| WarmupTickRate | float | WarmupTickRate - the time step for each tick during warm up.<br>		Set to 0 to use the default tick time. |  |
| bEnableSeparateRendering | bool |  |  |
| Emitters | TArray < UParticleEmitter * > | Emitters	- internal - the array of emitters in the system |  |
| PreviewComponent | UParticleSystemComponent * | The component used to preview the particle system in Cascade |  |
| CurveEdSetup | UInterpCurveEdSetup * | Used for curve editor to remember curve-editing setup. |  |
| bOrientZAxisTowardCamera | uint32 | If true, the system's Z axis will be oriented toward the camera |  |

| bUseUltraDeviceBias | bool |  |  |
| bUseDeviceQualityBias | bool |  |  |
| bUsePCDeviceConstBias | bool |  |  |
| bUseCustomCullDistance | bool |  |  |
| bUseAbsoluteDistance | bool | default false ,use for cull distance not affected by r.ViewDistanceScale |  |
| CustomCullDistance | float | default 0 ,use for mobile particle distance cull |  |
| CustomPCCullDistance | float | default -1 then use same distance as mobile do |  |
| CullDistanceCheckTime | float |  |  |
| LODMethod | TEnumAsByte < enum ParticleSystemLODMethod > | The method of LOD level determination to utilize for this particle system<br>	 	  PARTICLESYSTEMLODMETHOD_Automatic - Automatically set the LOD level, checking every LODDistanceCheckTime seconds.<br>	     PARTICLESYSTEMLODMETHOD_DirectSet - LOD level is directly set by the game code.<br>	     PARTICLESYSTEMLODMETHOD_ActivateAutomatic - LOD level is determined at Activation time, then left alone unless directly set by game code. |  |
| LODDistances | TArray < float > | The array of distances for each LOD level in the system.<br>	 	Used when LODMethod is set to PARTICLESYSTEMLODMETHOD_Automatic.<br>	 <br>	 	Example: System with 3 LOD levels<br>	 		LODDistances(0) = 0.0<br>	 		LODDistances(1) = 2500.0<br>	 		LODDistances(2) = 5000.0<br>	 <br>	 		In this case, when the system is [   0.0 ..   2499.9] from the camera, LOD level 0 will be used.<br>	 										 [2500.0 ..   4999.9] from the camera, LOD level 1 will be used.<br>	 										 [5000.0 .. INFINITY] from the camera, LOD level 2 will be used. |  |
| bRegenerateLODDuplicate | uint32 | Internal value that tracks the regenerate LOD levels preference.<br>	 	If true, when autoregenerating LOD levels in code, the low level will<br>	 	be a duplicate of the high. |  |

| bUseFixedRelativeBoundingBox | uint32 | Whether to use the fixed relative bounding box or calculate it every frame. |  |
| FixedRelativeBoundingBox | FBox | Fixed relative bounding box for particle system. |  |
| SecondsBeforeInactive | float | Number of seconds of emitter not being rendered that need to pass before it<br>	  no longer gets ticked becomes inactive. |  |
| bShouldResetPeakCounts | uint32 | EDITOR ONLY: Indicates that Cascade would like to have the PeakActiveParticles count reset |  |
| bHasPhysics | uint32 | Set during load time to indicate that physics is used... |  |
| bUseRealtimeThumbnail | uint32 | Inidicates the old 'real-time' thumbnail rendering should be used |  |
| ThumbnailImageOutOfDate | uint32 | Internal: Indicates the PSys thumbnail image is out of date |  |
| Delay | float | How long this Particle system should delay when ActivateSystem is called on it. |  |
| DelayLow | float | The low end of the emitter delay if using a range. |  |
| bUseDelayRange | uint32 | If true, select the emitter delay from the range <br>	 		[DelayLow..Delay] |  |

| InsignificantReaction | EParticleSystemInsignificanceReaction | The reaction this system takes when all emitters are insignificant. |  |
| InsignificanceDelay | float | Time delay between all emitters becoming insignificant and the systems insignificant reaction. |  |
| MaxSignificanceLevel | EParticleSignificanceLevel | The maximum level of significance for emitters in this system. Any emitters with a higher significance will be capped at this significance level. |  |
