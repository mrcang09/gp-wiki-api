## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bUseInverseSquaredFalloff | bool | Whether to use physically based inverse squared falloff from the light.  If unchecked, the LightExponent distribution will be used instead. |  |
| bAffectsTranslucency | bool | Whether lights from this module should affect translucency.<br>	  Use with caution.  Modules enabling this should only make a few particle lights at most, and the smaller they are, the less they will cost. |  |
| bPreviewLightRadius | bool | Will draw wireframe spheres to preview the light radius if enabled.<br>	  Note: this is intended for previewing and the value will not be saved, it will always revert to disabled. |  |
| SpawnFraction | float | Fraction of particles in this emitter to create lights on. |  |
| ColorScaleOverLife | FRawDistributionVector | Scale that is applied to the particle's color to calculate the light's color, and can be setup as a curve over the particle's lifetime. |  |
| BrightnessOverLife | FRawDistributionFloat | Brightness scale for the light, which can be setup as a curve over the particle's lifetime. |  |
| RadiusScale | FRawDistributionFloat | Scales the particle's radius, to calculate the light's radius. |  |
| LightExponent | FRawDistributionFloat | Provides the light's exponent when inverse squared falloff is disabled. |  |
| LightingChannels | FLightingChannels | Channels that this light should affect.<br>	 Only affect high quality lights<br>	 These channels only apply to opaque materials, direct lighting, and dynamic lighting and shadowing. |  |
| VolumetricScatteringIntensity | float | Intensity of the volumetric scattering from this light.  This scales Intensity and LightColor. |  |
| bHighQualityLights | bool | Converts the particle lights into high quality lights as if they came from a PointLightComponent.  High quality lights cost significantly more on both CPU and GPU. |  |
| bShadowCastingLights | bool | Whether to cast shadows from the particle lights.  Requires High Quality Lights to be enabled.<br>	  Warning: This can be incredibly expensive on the GPU - use with caution. |  |
