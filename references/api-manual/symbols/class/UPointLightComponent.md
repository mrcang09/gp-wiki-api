## Description

A light component which emits light from a single point equally in all directions.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Radius_DEPRECATED | float |  |  |
| AttenuationRadius | float | Bounds the light's visible influence.  <br>	  This clamping of the light's influence is not physically correct but very important for performance, larger lights cost more. |  |
| bUseInverseSquaredFalloff | uint32 | Whether to use physically based inverse squared distance falloff, where AttenuationRadius is only clamping the light's contribution.  <br>	  Disabling inverse squared falloff can be useful when placing fill lights (don't want a super bright spot near the light).<br>	  When enabled, the light's Intensity is in units of lumens, where 1700 lumens is a 100W lightbulb.<br>	  When disabled, the light's Intensity is a brightness scale. |  |
| LightFalloffExponent | float | Controls the radial falloff of the light when UseInverseSquaredFalloff is disabled. <br>	  2 is almost linear and very unrealistic and around 8 it looks reasonable.<br>	  With large exponents, the light has contribution to only a small area of its influence radius but still costs the same as low exponents. |  |
| SourceRadius | float | Radius of light source shape.<br>	  Note that light sources shapes which intersect shadow casting geometry can cause shadowing artifacts. |  |
| SoftSourceRadius | float | Soft radius of light source shape.<br>	 Note that light sources shapes which intersect shadow casting geometry can cause shadowing artifacts. |  |
| SourceLength | float | Length of light source shape.<br>	  Note that light sources shapes which intersect shadow casting geometry can cause shadowing artifacts. |  |
| bSimulateRectLight | uint32 | By luciuszhang: when in rect light mode, source radius is the rect light source width. |  |
| bSimulatePortalLight | uint32 | By luciuszhang: Portal light will be used in lightmass for IdeaBake, it is just a flag for Rect Light. |  |
| RectLightSourceWidth | float | By luciuszhang: rect light source width. |  |
| RectLightSourceHeight | float | By luciuszhang: rect light source height. |  |
| bEnableForVertexPointLight | uint32 |  |  |
| LightmassSettings | FLightmassPointLightSettings | The Lightmass settings for this object. |  |
