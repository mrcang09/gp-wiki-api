## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Position | FExpressionInput | 2 to 3 dimensional vector |  |
| FilterWidth | FExpressionInput | scalar, to clamp the Levels at pixel level, can be computed like this: max(length(ddx(Position)), length(ddy(Position)) |  |
| Scale | float | can also be done with a multiply on the Position |  |
| Quality | int32 | Lower numbers are faster and lower quality, higher numbers are slower and higher quality |  |
| NoiseFunction | TEnumAsByte < enum ENoiseFunction > | Noise function, affects performance and look |  |
| bTurbulence | uint32 | How multiple frequencies are getting combined |  |
| Levels | int32 | 1 = fast but little detail, .. larger numbers cost more performance |  |
| OutputMin | float |  |  |
| OutputMax | float |  |  |
| LevelScale | float | usually 2 but higher values allow efficient use of few levels |  |
| bTiling | uint32 | Whether to use tiling noise pattern, useful for baking to seam-free repeating textures |  |
| RepeatSize | uint32 | How many units in each tile (if Tiling is on) |  |
