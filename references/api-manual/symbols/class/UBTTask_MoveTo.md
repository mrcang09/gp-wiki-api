| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| FilterClass | TSubclassOf < UNavigationQueryFilter > | "None" will result in default filter being used |  |
| ObservedBlackboardValueTolerance | float | if task is expected to react to changes to location represented by BB key <br>	 	this property can be used to tweak sensitivity of the mechanism. Value is <br>	 	recommended to be less then AcceptableRadius |  |
| bObserveBlackboardValue | uint32 | if move goal in BB changes the move will be redirected to new location |  |
| bAllowStrafe | uint32 |  |  |
| bAllowPartialPath | uint32 | if set, use incomplete path when goal can't be reached |  |
| bTrackMovingGoal | uint32 | if set, path to goal actor will update itself when actor moves |  |
| bProjectGoalLocation | uint32 | if set, goal location will be projected on navigation data (navmesh) before using |  |
| bReachTestIncludesAgentRadius | uint32 | if set, radius of AI's capsule will be added to threshold between AI and goal location in destination reach test |  |
| bReachTestIncludesGoalRadius | uint32 | if set, radius of goal's capsule will be added to threshold between AI and goal location in destination reach test |  |
| bStopOnOverlap | uint32 | DEPRECATED, please use combination of bReachTestIncludesRadius instead |  |
