## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BlueprintContainer | TSubclassOf < AActor > |  |  |

| bEnableWorldBoundsChecks | uint32 | DEFAULT BASIC PHYSICS SETTINGS <br>	 If true, enables CheckStillInWorld checks |  |
| bEnableNavigationSystem | uint32 | if set to false navigation system will not get created (and all navigation functionality won't be accessible) |  |
| bEnableAISystem | uint32 | if set to false AI system will not get created. Use it to disable all AI-related activity on a map |  |
| bEnalbeLevelLoadConditionControl | uint32 |  |  |
| bEnableWorldComposition | uint32 | Enables tools for composing a tiled world.<br>	  Level has to be saved and all sub-levels removed before enabling this option. |  |
| bWorldCompositionPIESupportLevelRotation | uint32 |  |  |
| bPIECloseFixupLazyPointers | uint32 |  |  |
| bEnableRescanRestriction | uint32 |  |  |
| bOnlyIncludeWhiteList | uint32 |  |  |
| bAlwaysExcludeBlackList | uint32 |  |  |
| WhiteListRescanFolders | TArray < FString > |  |  |
| WhiteListRescanLevelPaths | TArray < FString > |  |  |
| BlackListRescanFolders | TArray < FString > |  |  |
| BlackListRescanLevelPaths | TArray < FString > |  |  |
| bUseClientSideLevelStreamingVolumes | uint32 | Enables client-side streaming volumes instead of server-side.<br>	  Expected usage scenario: server has all streaming levels always loaded, clients independently stream levels inout based on streaming volumes. |  |
| bEnableWorldOriginRebasing | uint32 | World origin will shift to a camera position when camera goes far away from current origin |  |
| bWorldGravitySet | uint32 | if set to true, when we call GetGravityZ we assume WorldGravityZ has already been initialized and skip the lookup of DefaultGravityZ and GlobalGravityZ |  |
| bGlobalGravitySet | uint32 | If set to true we will use GlobalGravityZ instead of project setting DefaultGravityZ |  |
| KillZ | float |  |  |
| KillZDamageType | TSubclassOf < UDamageType > |  |  |
| WorldGravityZ | float |  |  |
| GlobalGravityZ | float |  |  |
| DefaultPhysicsVolumeClass | TSubclassOf < ADefaultPhysicsVolume > |  |  |
| PhysicsCollisionHandlerClass | TSubclassOf < UPhysicsCollisionHandler > |  |  |
| DefaultGameMode | TSubclassOf < AGameModeBase > | GAMEMODE SETTINGS <br>	 The default GameMode to use when starting this map in the game. If this value is NULL, the INI setting for default game type is used. |  |
| GameNetworkManagerClass | TSubclassOf < AGameNetworkManager > | Class of GameNetworkManager to spawn for network games |  |
| StreamVolumeExManagerClass | TSubclassOf < AStreamVolumeExManager > |  |  |
| PackedLightAndShadowMapTextureSize | int32 | RENDERING SETTINGS <br>	 Maximum size of textures for packed light and shadow maps |  |
| bMinimizeBSPSections | uint32 | Causes the BSP build to generate as few sections as possible.<br>	  This is useful when you need to reduce draw calls but can reduce texture streaming efficiency and effective lightmap resolution.<br>	  Note - changes require a rebuild to propagate.  Also, be sure to select all surfaces and make sure they all have the same flags to minimize section count. |  |
| DefaultColorScale | FVector | Default color scale for the level |  |
| DefaultMaxDistanceFieldOcclusionDistance | float | Max occlusion distance used by mesh distance fields, overridden if there is a movable skylight. |  |
| GlobalDistanceFieldViewDistance | float | Distance from the camera that the global distance field should cover. |  |
| bEnableUpdateTransformViewTranslated | uint32 |  |  |
| bEnableWorldComposition2DLoading | uint32 |  |  |
| MaxWorldSize | float |  |  |
| RegionSizeNear | int32 |  |  |
| RegionSizeFar | int32 |  |  |
| RegionXAdd | bool |  |  |
| RegionYAdd | bool |  |  |
| UnlimitedRegionZ | bool |  |  |
| Graduation | int32 |  |  |
| CompositionSize | int32 |  |  |
| DynamicIndirectShadowsSelfShadowingIntensity | float | Controls the intensity of self-shadowing from capsule indirect shadows.<br>	  These types of shadows use approximate occluder representations, so reducing self-shadowing intensity can hide those artifacts. |  |
| bPrecomputeVisibility | uint32 | PRECOMPUTED VISIBILITY SETTINGS <br>	<br>	  Whether to place visibility cells inside Precomputed Visibility Volumes and along camera tracks in this level.<br>	  Precomputing visibility reduces rendering thread time at the cost of some runtime memory and somewhat increased lighting build times. |  |
| bPlaceCellsOnlyAlongCameraTracks | uint32 | Whether to place visibility cells only along camera tracks or only above shadow casting surfaces. |  |
| VisibilityCellSize | int32 | World space size of precomputed visibility cells in x and y.<br>	  Smaller sizes produce more effective occlusion culling at the cost of increased runtime memory usage and lighting build times. |  |
| PlayAreaHeight | float | Play Area Height ( Cell Z |  |
| DynamicCellSize | FVector2D | Dynamic Cell Size ( Dynamic Cell XY, Z |  |
| PrecomputedVisibilitySettings | FLightmassPrecomputedVisibilitySettings |  |  |
| VisibilityAggressiveness | TEnumAsByte < enum EVisibilityAggressiveness > | Determines how aggressive precomputed visibility should be.<br>	  More aggressive settings cull more objects but also cause more visibility errors like popping. |  |
| bForceNoPrecomputedLighting | uint32 | LIGHTMASS RELATED SETTINGS <br>	<br>	  Whether to force lightmaps and other precomputed lighting to not be created even when the engine thinks they are needed.<br>	  This is useful for improving iteration in levels with fully dynamic lighting and shadowing.<br>	  Note that any lighting and shadowing interactions that are usually precomputed will be lost if this is enabled. |  |
| bUseLightmassSettingsIsolation | uint32 |  |  |
| LightmassSettings | FLightmassWorldInfoSettings |  |  |
| LightmassSettingsForPC | FLightmassWorldInfoSettings |  |  |

| DefaultAmbientZoneSettings | FInteriorSettings | Default interior settings used by audio volumes. |  |
| DefaultBaseSoundMix | USoundMix * | Default Base SoundMix. |  |
| WorldToMeters | float | DEFAULT SETTINGS <br>	 scale of 1uu to 1m in real world measurements, for HMD and other physically tracked devices (e.g. 1uu = 1cm would be 100.0) |  |
| MonoCullingDistance | float | Distance from the player after which content will be rendered in mono if monoscopic far field rendering is activated |  |
| BookMarks | UBookMark * | EDITOR ONLY SETTINGS <br>	 Level Bookmarks: 10 should be MAX_BOOKMARK_NUMBER @fixmeconst |  |
| TimeDilation | float | Normally 1 - scales real time passage.<br>	  Warning - most use cases should use GetEffectiveTimeDilation() instead of reading from this directly |  |
| MatineeTimeDilation | float |  |  |
| DemoPlayTimeDilation | float |  |  |
| MinGlobalTimeDilation | float | Lowest acceptable global time dilation. |  |
| MaxGlobalTimeDilation | float | Highest acceptable global time dilation. |  |
| MinUndilatedFrameTime | float | Smallest possible frametime, not considering dilation. Equiv to 1FastestFPS. |  |
| MaxUndilatedFrameTime | float | Largest possible frametime, not considering dilation. Equiv to 1SlowestFPS. |  |
| Pauser | APlayerState * |  |  |
| bHighPriorityLoading | uint32 | when this flag is set, more time is allocated to background loading (replicated) |  |
| bHighPriorityLoadingLocal | uint32 | copy of bHighPriorityLoading that is not replicated, for clientside-only loading operations |  |
| ReplicationViewers | TArray < struct FNetViewer > | valid only during replication - information about the player(s) being replicated to<br>	  (there could be more than one in the case of a splitscreen client) |  |
| AssetUserData | TArray < UAssetUserData * > | Array of user data stored with the asset |  |
| LODRelativeDistances | TArray < float > |  |  |
| bEnablestreamingLevelLOD | bool |  |  |
| WorldCompositionNums | int32 |  |  |
| CompositionBlockLength | int32 |  |  |
| OriginOfTheRegion | FVector |  |  |
| bEnableObjectPool | bool |  |  |
| LevelReorganizationData | UDataAsset * |  |  |
| bEnableHierarchicalLODSystem | uint32 | if set to true, hierarchical LODs will be built, which will create hierarchical LODActors |  |
| HLODSetupAsset | TSoftClassPtr < UHierarchicalLODSetup > | If set overrides the level settings and global project settings |  |
| OverrideBaseMaterial | TSoftObjectPtr < UMaterialInterface > | If set overrides the project-wide base material used for Proxy Materials |  |
| HierarchicalLODSetup | TArray < struct FHierarchicalSimplification > | Hierarchical LOD Setup |  |
| NumHLODLevels | int32 |  |  |
| bGenerateSingleClusterForLevel | uint32 | if set to true, all eligible actors in this level will be added to a single cluster representing the entire level (used for small sublevels) |  |
