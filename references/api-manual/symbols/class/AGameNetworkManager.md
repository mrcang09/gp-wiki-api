## Description

Handles game-specific networking management (cheat detection, bandwidth management, etc.).

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AdjustedNetSpeed | int32 | Current adjusted net speed - Used for dynamically managing netspeed for listen servers |  |
| LastNetSpeedUpdateTime | float | Last time netspeed was updated for server (by client entering or leaving) |  |
| TotalNetBandwidth | int32 | Total available bandwidth for listen server, split dynamically across net connections |  |
| MinDynamicBandwidth | int32 | Minimum bandwidth dynamically set per connection |  |
| MaxDynamicBandwidth | int32 | Maximum bandwidth dynamically set per connection |  |
| bIsStandbyCheckingEnabled | uint32 | Used to determine if checking for standby cheats should occur |  |
| bHasStandbyCheatTriggered | uint32 | Used to determine whether we've already caught a cheat or not |  |
| StandbyRxCheatTime | float | The amount of time without packets before triggering the cheat code |  |
| StandbyTxCheatTime | float | The amount of time without packets before triggering the cheat code |  |
| BadPingThreshold | int32 | The point we determine the server is either delaying packets or has bad upstream |  |
| PercentMissingForRxStandby | float | The percentage of clients missing RX data before triggering the standby code |  |
| PercentMissingForTxStandby | float | The percentage of clients missing TX data before triggering the standby code |  |
| PercentForBadPing | float | The percentage of clients with bad ping before triggering the standby code |  |
| JoinInProgressStandbyWaitTime | float | The amount of time to wait before checking a connection for standby issues |  |
| MoveRepSize | float | Average size of replicated move packet (ServerMove() packet size) from player |  |
| MAXPOSITIONERRORSQUARED | float | MAXPOSITIONERRORSQUARED is the square of the max position error that is accepted (not corrected) in net play |  |
| MAXNEARZEROVELOCITYSQUARED | float | MAXNEARZEROVELOCITYSQUARED is the square of the max velocity that is considered zero (not corrected) in net play |  |
| CLIENTADJUSTUPDATECOST | float | CLIENTADJUSTUPDATECOST is the bandwidth cost in bytes of sending a client adjustment update. 180 is greater than the actual cost, but represents a tweaked value reserving enough bandwidth for<br>	other updates sent to the client.  Increase this value to reduce client adjustment update frequency, or if the amount of data sent in the clientadjustment() call increases |  |
| MAXCLIENTUPDATEINTERVAL | float | MAXCLIENTUPDATEINTERVAL is the maximum time between movement updates from the client before the server forces an update. |  |
| MaxMoveDeltaTime | float | MaxMoveDeltaTime is the default maximum time delta of CharacterMovement ServerMoves. Should be less than or equal to MAXCLIENTUPDATEINTERVAL, otherwise server will interfere by forcing position updates. |  |
| ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTime | float | ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTime is the default minimum time delta of CharacterMovement client moves to the server. When updates occur more frequently, they may be combined to save bandwidth.<br>	  This value is not used when player count is over ClientNetSendMoveThrottleOverPlayerCount or player net speed is <= ClientNetSendMoveThrottleAtNetSpeed (see ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTimeThrottled). |  |
| ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTimeThrottled | float | ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTimeThrottled is used in place of ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTime when player count is high or net speed is low. See ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTime for more info. |  |
| ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTimeStationary | float | ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTimeStationary is used when players are determined to not be moving or changing their view. See ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTime for more info. |  |
| ClientNetSendMoveThrottleAtNetSpeed | int32 | When player net speed (CurrentNetSpeed, based on ConfiguredInternetSpeed or ConfiguredLanSpeed) is less than or equal to this amount, ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTimeThrottled is used instead of ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTime. |  |
| ClientNetSendMoveThrottleOverPlayerCount | int32 | When player count is greater than this amount, ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTimeThrottled is used instead of ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTime. |  |
| ClientAuthorativePosition | bool | If client update is within MAXPOSITIONERRORSQUARED then he is authorative on his final position |  |
| ClientErrorUpdateRateLimit | float | Minimum delay between the server sending error corrections to a client, in seconds. |  |
| bMovementTimeDiscrepancyDetection | bool | Whether movement time discrepancy detection is enabled. |  |
| bMovementTimeDiscrepancyResolution | bool | Whether movement time discrepancy resolution is enabled (when detected, make client movement "pay back" excessive time discrepancies) |  |
| MovementTimeDiscrepancyMaxTimeMargin | float | Maximum time client can be ahead before triggering movement time discrepancy detectionresolution (if enabled). |  |
| MovementTimeDiscrepancyMinTimeMargin | float | Maximum time client can be behind. |  |
| MovementTimeDiscrepancyResolutionRate | float | During time discrepancy resolution, we "pay back" the time discrepancy at this rate for future moves until total error is zero.<br>	  1.0 = 100% resolution rate, meaning the next X ServerMoves from the client are fully paying back the time, <br>	  0.5 = 50% resolution rate, meaning future ServerMoves will spend 50% of tick continuing to move the character and 50% paying back.<br>	  Lowering from 100% could be used to produce less severenoticeable corrections, although typically we would want to correct<br>	  the client as quickly as possible. |  |
| MovementTimeDiscrepancyDriftAllowance | float | Accepted drift in clocks between client and server as a percent per second allowed. <br>	 <br>	  0.0 is "no forgiveness" and all logic would run on raw values, no tampering on the server side.<br>	  0.02 would be a 2% per second difference "forgiven" - if the time discrepancy in a given second was less than 2%,<br>	  the error handlingdetection code effectively ignores it.<br>	  <br>	  Increasing this value above 0% lessens the chance of false positives on time discrepancy (burst packet loss, performance<br>	  hitches), but also means anyone tampering with their client time below that percent will not be detected and no resolution<br>	  action will be taken, and anyone above that threshold will still gain the advantage of this % of time boost (if running at <br>	  10% speed-up and this value is 0.05 or 5% allowance, they would only be resolved down to a 5% speed boost).<br>	 <br>	  Time discrepancy detection code DOES keep track of LifetimeRawTimeDiscrepancy, which is unaffected by this drift allowance,<br>	  so cheating below DriftAllowance percent could be tracked and acted on outside of an individual game. For example, if DriftAllowance<br>	  was 0.05 (meaning we're not going to actively prevent any cheating below 5% boosts to ensure less false positives for normal players),<br>	  we could still post-process analytics of the game showing that Player X regularly runs at 4% speed boost and take action. |  |
| bMovementTimeDiscrepancyForceCorrectionsDuringResolution | bool | Whether client moves should be force corrected during time discrepancy resolution, useful for projects that have lenient <br>	  move error toleranceClientAuthorativePosition enabled. |  |
| bUseDistanceBasedRelevancy | bool | If true, actor network relevancy is constrained by whether they are within their NetCullDistanceSquared from the client's view point. |  |
