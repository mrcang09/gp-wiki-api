## Description

A light component that has parallel rays. Will provide a uniform lighting across any affected surface (eg. The Sun). This will affect all objects in the defined light-mass importance volume.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bEnableLightShaftOcclusion | uint32 | Whether to occlude fog and atmosphere inscattering with screenspace blurred occlusion from this light. |  |
| OcclusionMaskDarkness | float | Controls how dark the occlusion masking is, a value of 1 results in no darkening term. |  |
| OcclusionDepthRange | float | Everything closer to the camera than this distance will occlude light shafts. |  |
| LightShaftOverrideDirection | FVector | Can be used to make light shafts come from somewhere other than the light's actual direction.<br>	  This will only be used when non-zero.  It does not have to be normalized. |  |
| WholeSceneDynamicShadowRadius_DEPRECATED | float |  |  |
| DynamicShadowDistanceMovableLight | float | How far Cascaded Shadow Map dynamic shadows will cover for a movable light, measured from the camera.<br>	  A value of 0 disables the dynamic shadow. |  |
| DynamicShadowDistanceStationaryLight | float | How far Cascaded Shadow Map dynamic shadows will cover for a stationary light, measured from the camera.<br>	  A value of 0 disables the dynamic shadow. |  |
| DynamicShadowCascades | int32 | Number of cascades to split the view frustum into for the whole scene dynamic shadow.<br>	  More cascades result in better shadow resolution, but adds significant rendering cost. |  |
| CascadeDistributionExponent | float | Controls whether the cascades are distributed closer to the camera (larger exponent) or further from the camera (smaller exponent).<br>	  An exponent of 1 means that cascade transitions will happen at a distance proportional to their resolution. |  |
| CascadeTransitionFraction | float | Proportion of the fade region between cascades.<br>	  Pixels within the fade region of two cascades have their shadows blended to avoid hard transitions between quality levels.<br>	  A value of zero eliminates the fade region, creating hard transitions.<br>	  Higher values increase the size of the fade region, creating a more gradual transition between cascades.<br>	  The value is expressed as a percentage proportion (i.e. 0.1 = 10% overlap).<br>	  Ideal values are the smallest possible which still hide the transition.<br>	  An increased fade region size causes an increase in shadow rendering cost. |  |
| ShadowDistanceFadeoutFraction | float | Controls the size of the fade out region at the far extent of the dynamic shadow's influence.<br>	  This is specified as a fraction of DynamicShadowDistance. |  |
| bUseIndependentShadowBound | uint32 |  |  |
| ShadowCenterOffset | float | Offset of the CSM shadow center in the viewing direction. |  |
| ShadowIndependentRadius | float |  |  |
| bUseInsetShadowsForMovableObjects | uint32 | Stationary lights only: Whether to use per-object inset shadows for movable components, even though cascaded shadow maps are enabled.<br>	  This allows dynamic objects to have a shadow even when they are outside of the cascaded shadow map, which is important when DynamicShadowDistanceStationaryLight is small.<br>	  If DynamicShadowDistanceStationaryLight is large (currently > 8000), this will be forced off.<br>	  Disabling this can reduce shadowing cost significantly with many movable objects. |  |
| FarShadowCascadeCount | int32 | 0: no DistantShadowCascades, otherwise the count of cascades between WholeSceneDynamicShadowRadius and DistantShadowDistance that are covered by distant shadow cascades. |  |
| FarShadowDistance | float | Distance at which the far shadow cascade should end.  Far shadows will cover the range between 'Dynamic Shadow Distance' and this distance. |  |
| DistanceFieldShadowDistance | float | Distance at which the ray traced shadow cascade should end.  Distance field shadows will cover the range between 'Dynamic Shadow Distance' this distance. |  |
| ForwardShadingPriority | int32 | Forward lighting priority for the single directional light that will be used for forward shading, translucent, single layer water and volumetric fog.<br>	 When two lights have equal priorities, the selection will be based on their overall brightness as a fallback. |  |
| LightSourceAngle | float | Light source angle in degrees, used for dynamic shadowing methods.<br>	  Currently only Ray Traced Distance Field shadows and Capsule shadows support area shadows, and therefore make use of LightSourceAngle. |  |
| TraceDistance | float | Determines how far shadows can be cast, in world units.  Larger values increase the shadowing cost. |  |
| LightmassSettings | FLightmassDirectionalLightSettings | The Lightmass settings for this object. |  |
| bCastModulatedShadows | uint32 | Whether the light should cast modulated shadows from dynamic objects (mobile only).  Also requires Cast Shadows to be set to True. |  |
| bCastsLandscapeShadow | uint32 |  |  |
| LandscapeShadowColor | float |  |  |
| LandscapeShadowOffset | float |  |  |
| LandscapeShadowSoftHeight | float |  |  |
| LandscapeShadowPixelPrecision | float |  |  |
| LandscapeGeometry | ULandscapeGeometryAsset * |  |  |
| bCastPhotonShadow | uint32 | #if WITH_PHOTON_SHADOW<br>	 Whether the light should cast photon shadow for character<br>	 #endif |  |
| bCastPhotonPerObjectShadow | uint32 |  |  |
| SoftShadowSoftness | float |  |  |
| ShadowBlendFactor | float |  |  |
| BoundsScale | float |  |  |
| NearPlaneOffset | float |  |  |
| FarPlaneOffset | float |  |  |
| SplitNearOffset | float |  |  |
| SplitFarOffset | float |  |  |
| ShadowMapResolution | float |  |  |
| ModulatedShadowColor | FColor | Color to modulate against the scene color when rendering modulated shadows. (mobile only) |  |
| ACESParameters | TArray < FACESParameter > |  |  |
| bUsedAsAtmosphereSunLight | uint32 |  |  |
| bCastsCloudShadow | uint32 |  |  |
| CloudShadowTexture | UTexture * |  |  |
| CloudShadowTileSize | float |  |  |
| CloudShadowDensity | float |  |  |
| CloudShadowWinSpeed | FVector2D |  |  |
| bUseGridShadow | uint32 |  |  |
| GridShadowSplitSettings | TArray < FGridShadowSplitSettings > |  |  |
