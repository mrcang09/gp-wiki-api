## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SourceType | TEnumAsByte < enum ELocationSkelVertSurfaceSource > | Whether the module uses Verts or Surfaces for locations.<br>	 <br>	 	VERTSURFACESOURCE_Vert		- Use Verts as the source locations.<br>	 	VERTSURFACESOURCE_Surface	- Use Surfaces as the source locations. |  |
| UniversalOffset | FVector | An offset to apply to each vertsurface |  |
| bUpdatePositionEachFrame | uint32 | If true, update the particle locations each frame with that of the vertsurface |  |
| bOrientMeshEmitters | uint32 | If true, rotate mesh emitter meshes to orient w the vertsurface |  |
| bInheritBoneVelocity | uint32 | If true, particles inherit the associated bone velocity when spawned |  |
| InheritVelocityScale | float | A scale on how much of the bone's velocity a particle will inherit. |  |
| SkelMeshActorParamName | FName | The parameter name of the skeletal mesh actor that supplies the SkelMeshComponent for in-game. |  |
| ValidAssociatedBones | TArray < FName > | This module will only spawn from verts or surfaces associated with the bones in this list |  |
| bEnforceNormalCheck | uint32 | When true use the RestrictToNormal and NormalTolerance values to check surface normals |  |
| NormalToCompare | FVector | Use this normal to restrict spawning locations |  |
| NormalCheckToleranceDegrees | float | Normal tolerance.  0 degrees means it must be an exact match, 180 degrees means it can be any angle. |  |
| NormalCheckTolerance | float | Normal tolerance.  Value between 1.0 and -1.0 with 1.0 being exact match, 0.0 being everything up to<br>		perpendicular and -1.0 being any direction or don't restrict at all. |  |
| ValidMaterialIndices | TArray < int32 > | Array of material indices that are valid materials to spawn from.<br>	 	If empty, any material will be considered valid |  |
| bInheritVertexColor | uint32 | If true, particles inherit the associated vertex color on spawn. This feature is not supported for GPU particles. |  |
| bInheritUV | uint32 | If true, particles inherit the associated UV data on spawn. Accessed through dynamic parameter module X and Y, must be a "Spawn Time Only" parameter on "AutoSet" mode. This feature is not supported for GPU particles. |  |
| InheritUVChannel | uint32 | UV channel to inherit from the spawn mesh, internally clamped to those available. |  |
| EditorSkelMesh | USkeletalMesh * | The name of the skeletal mesh to use in the editor |  |
