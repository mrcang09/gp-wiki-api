## Description

CanvasRenderTarget2D is 2D render target which exposes a Canvas interface to allow you to draw elements onto 
  it directly.  Use CreateCanvasRenderTarget2D() to create a render target texture by unique name, then
  bind a function to the OnCanvasRenderTargetUpdate delegate which will be called when the render target is
  updated.  If you need to repaint your canvas every single frame, simply call UpdateResource() on it from a Tick
  function.  Also, remember to hold onto your new canvas render target with a reference so that it doesn't get
  garbage collected.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| World | TWeakObjectPtr < UWorld > | The world this render target will be used with |  |
| bShouldClearRenderTargetOnReceiveUpdate | bool |  |  |

## Functions

### UpdateResource

Updates the the canvas render target texture's resource. This is where the render target will create or 
	  find a canvas object to use.  It also calls UpdateResourceImmediate() to clear the render target texture 
	  from the deferred rendering list, to stop the texture from being cleared the next frame. From there it
	  will ask the rendering thread to set up the RHI viewport. The canvas is then set up for rendering and 
	  then the user's update delegate is called.  The canvas is then flushed and the RHI resolves the 
	  texture to make it available for rendering.

|  | void  |  |  |

### GetSize

Gets a specific render target's size from the global map of canvas render targets.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
