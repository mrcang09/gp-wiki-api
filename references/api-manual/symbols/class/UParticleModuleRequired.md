| EmitterSelfRotationSpeed | float |  |  |
| ScreenAlignment | TEnumAsByte < EParticleScreenAlignment > | The screen alignment to utilize for the emitter at this LOD level.<br>	 	One of the following:<br>	 	PSA_FacingCameraPosition - Faces the camera position, but is not dependent on the camera rotation.  <br>	 								This method produces more stable particles under camera rotation.<br>	 	PSA_Square			- Uniform scale (via SizeX) facing the camera<br>	 	PSA_Rectangle		- Non-uniform scale (via SizeX and SizeY) facing the camera<br>	 	PSA_Velocity		- Orient the particle towards both the camera and the direction <br>	 						  the particle is moving. Non-uniform scaling is allowed.<br>	 	PSA_TypeSpecific	- Use the alignment method indicated in the type data module.<br>	 	PSA_FacingCameraDistanceBlend - Blends between PSA_FacingCameraPosition and PSA_Square over specified distance. |  |
| MinFacingCameraBlendDistance | float | The distance at which PSA_FacingCameraDistanceBlend	is fully PSA_Square |  |

| bUseLocalSpace | uint32 | If true, update the emitter in local space |  |

| SortMode | TEnumAsByte < enum EParticleSortMode > | The sorting mode to use for this emitter.<br>	 	PSORTMODE_None				- No sorting required.<br>	 	PSORTMODE_ViewProjDepth		- Sort by view projected depth of the particle.<br>	 	PSORTMODE_DistanceToView	- Sort by distance of particle to view in world space.<br>	 	PSORTMODE_Age_OldestFirst	- Sort by age, oldest drawn first.<br>	 	PSORTMODE_Age_NewestFirst	- Sort by age, newest drawn first. |  |
| bConsiderOrbitOffsetWhenSort | uint32 |  |  |
| bUseLegacyEmitterTime | uint32 | If true, the EmitterTime for the emitter will be calculated by<br>	 	modulating the SecondsSinceCreation by the EmitterDuration. As<br>	 	this can lead to issues w looping and variable duration, a new<br>	 	approach has been implemented. <br>	 	If false, this new approach is utilized, and the EmitterTime is<br>	 	simply incremented by DeltaTime each tick. When the emitter <br>	 	loops, it adjusts the EmitterTime by the current EmitterDuration<br>	 	resulting in proper loopingdelay behavior. |  |
| bRemoveHMDRoll | uint32 | If true, removes the HMD view roll (e.g. in VR) |  |
| EmitterDuration | float | How long, in seconds, the emitter will run before looping. |  |

| InterpolationMethod | TEnumAsByte < EParticleSubUVInterpMethod > | The interpolation method to used for the SubUV image selection.<br>	 	One of the following:<br>	 	PSUVIM_None			- Do not apply SubUV modules to this emitter. <br>	 	PSUVIM_Linear		- Smoothly transition between sub-images in the given order, <br>	 						  with no blending between the current and the next<br>	 	PSUVIM_Linear_Blend	- Smoothly transition between sub-images in the given order, <br>	 						  blending between the current and the next <br>	 	PSUVIM_Random		- Pick the next image at random, with no blending between <br>	 						  the current and the next <br>	 	PSUVIM_Random_Blend	- Pick the next image at random, blending between the current <br>	 						  and the next |  |

| CutoutTexture | UTexture2D * | Texture to generate bounding geometry from. |  |
| BoundingMode | TEnumAsByte < enum ESubUVBoundingVertexCount > | More bounding vertices results in reduced overdraw, but adds more triangle overhead.<br>	 The eight vertex mode is best used when the SubUV texture has a lot of space to cut out that is not captured by the four vertex version,<br>	 and when the particles using the texture will be few and large. |  |
