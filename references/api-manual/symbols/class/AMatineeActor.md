## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MatineeData | UInterpData * | The matinee data used by this actor |  |
| MatineeControllerName | FName | Name of controller node in level script, used to know what function to try and find for events |  |
| PlayRate | float | Time multiplier for playback. |  |
| bPlayOnLevelLoad | uint32 | If true, the matinee will play when the level is loaded. |  |
| bForceStartPos | uint32 | Lets you force the sequence to always start at ForceStartPosition |  |
| ForceStartPosition | float | Time position to always start at if bForceStartPos is set to true. |  |
| bLooping | uint32 | If sequence should pop back to beginning when finished.<br>	 	Note, if true, will never get CompletedReversed events - sequence must be explicitly Stopped. |  |
| bRewindOnPlay | uint32 | If true, sequence will rewind itself back to the start each time the Play input is activated. |  |
| bNoResetOnRewind | uint32 | If true, when rewinding this interpolation, reset the 'initial positions' of any RelateToInitial movements to the current location.<br>	 	This allows the next loop of movement to proceed from the current locations. |  |
| bRewindIfAlreadyPlaying | uint32 | Only used if bRewindOnPlay if true. Defines what should happen if the Play input is activated while currently playing.<br>	 	If true, hitting Play while currently playing will pop the position back to the start and begin playback over again.<br>	 	If false, hitting Play while currently playing will do nothing. |  |
| bDisableRadioFilter | uint32 | If true, disables the realtime radio effect |  |
| bClientSideOnly | uint32 | Indicates that this interpolation does not affect gameplay. This means that:<br>	  -it is not replicated via MatineeActor<br>	  -it is not ticked if no affected Actors are visible<br>	  -on dedicated servers, it is completely ignored |  |
| bSkipUpdateIfNotVisible | uint32 | if bClientSideOnly is true, whether this matinee should be completely skipped if none of the affected Actors are visible |  |
| bIsSkippable | uint32 | Lets you skip the matinee with the CANCELMATINEE exec command. Triggers all events to the end along the way. |  |
| PreferredSplitScreenNum | int32 | Preferred local viewport number (when split screen is active) the director track should associate with, or zero for 'all'. |  |
| bDisableMovementInput | uint32 | Disable Input from player during play |  |
| bDisableLookAtInput | uint32 | Disable LookAt Input from player during play |  |
| bHidePlayer | uint32 | Hide Player Pawn during play |  |
| bHideHud | uint32 | Hide HUD during play |  |
| GroupActorInfos | TArray < struct FInterpGroupActorInfo > | @todo UE4 matinee - shouldnt be directly editable.  Needs a nice interface in matinee |  |
| bShouldShowGore | uint32 | Cached value that indicates whether or not gore was enabled when the sequence was started |  |
| GroupInst | TArray < UInterpGroupInst * > | Instance data for interp groups. One for each variablegroup combination. |  |
| CameraCuts | TArray < struct FCameraCutInfo > | Contains the camera world-position for each camera cut in the cinematic. |  |
| bIsPlaying | uint32 | properties that may change on InterpAction that we need to notify clients about, since the object's properties will not be replicated |  |
| bReversePlayback | uint32 |  |  |
| bPaused | uint32 |  |  |
| bPendingStop | uint32 |  |  |
| InterpPosition | float |  |  |
| ReplicationForceIsPlaying | uint8 | Counter to indicate that play count has changed. Used to work around single frames that go from play-stop-play where bIsPlaying won't get replicated. |  |

## Functions

### Play

Begin playback of the matinee. Only called in game.
	  Will then advance Position by (PlayRate  Deltatime) each time the matinee is ticked.

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void |  |  |

### Stop

Stops playback at the current position

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void |  |  |

### Reverse

Similar to play, but the playback will go backwards until the beginning of the sequence is reached.

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void |  |  |

### Pause

Hold playback at its current position. Calling Pause again will continue playback in its current direction.

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void |  |  |

### SetPosition

Set the position of the interpolation.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NewPosition | float  | the new position to set the interpolation to |  |
| bJump | bool | if true, teleport to the new position (don't trigger any events between the old and new positions, etc) |  |

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void  |  |  |

### ChangePlaybackDirection

Changes the direction of playback (go in reverse if it was going forward, or vice versa)

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void |  |  |

### SetLoopingState

Change the looping behaviour of this matinee

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bNewLooping | bool |  |  |

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void  |  |  |

### EnableGroupByName

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GroupName | FString  |  |  |
