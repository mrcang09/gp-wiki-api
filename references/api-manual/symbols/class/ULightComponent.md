## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Temperature | float | Color temperature in Kelvin of the blackbody illuminant.<br>	 White (D65) is 6500K. |  |
| MaxDrawDistance | float |  |  |
| MaxDistanceFadeRange | float |  |  |
| bUseTemperature | uint32 | false: use white (D65) as illuminant. |  |
| ShadowMapChannel_DEPRECATED | int32 | Legacy shadowmap channel from the lighting build, now stored in FLightComponentMapBuildData. |  |
| MinRoughness | float | Min roughness effective for this light. Used for softening specular highlights. |  |
| SpecularScale | float | Multiplier on specular highlights. Use only with great care! Any value besides 1 is not physical!<br>	 Can be used to artistically remove highlights mimicking polarizing filters or photo touch up. |  |
| bLocalLightDisableDiffuse | uint32 | Local light disable diffuse |  |
| ShadowResolutionScale | float | Scales the resolution of shadowmaps used to shadow this light.  By default shadowmap resolution is chosen based on screen size of the caster. <br>	  Note: shadowmap resolution is still clamped by 'r.Shadow.MaxResolution' |  |
| LightPriority | int32 | Light priority for mobile light grid |  |
| ShadowBias | float | Controls how accurate self shadowing of whole scene shadows from this light are.  <br>	  At 0, shadows will start at the their caster surface, but there will be many self shadowing artifacts.<br>	  larger values, shadows will start further from their caster, and there won't be self shadowing artifacts but object might appear to fly.<br>	  around 0.5 seems to be a good tradeoff. This also affects the soft transition of shadows |  |
| ShadowSharpen | float | Amount to sharpen shadow filtering |  |
| ContactShadowLength | float | Length of screen space ray trace for sharp contact shadows. Zero is disabled. |  |
| InverseSquaredFalloff_DEPRECATED | uint32 |  |  |
| bCacheStaticShadows | uint32 |  |  |
| CastTranslucentShadows | uint32 | Whether the light is allowed to cast dynamic shadows from translucency. |  |
| bCastShadowsFromCinematicObjectsOnly | uint32 | Whether the light should only cast shadows from components marked as bCastCinematicShadows. <br>	  This is useful for setting up cinematic Movable spotlights aimed at characters and avoiding the shadow depth rendering costs of the background.<br>	  Note: this only works with dynamic shadow maps, not with static shadowing or Ray Traced Distance Field shadows. |  |
| bAffectDynamicIndirectLighting | uint32 | Whether the light should be injected into the Light Propagation Volume |  |
| LightingChannels | FLightingChannels | Channels that this light should affect.  <br>	  These channels only apply to opaque materials, direct lighting, and dynamic lighting and shadowing. |  |
| LightFunctionMaterial | UMaterialInterface * | The light function material to be applied to this light.<br>	  Note that only non-lightmapped lights (UseDirectLightMap=False) can have a light function. |  |
| LightFunctionScale | FVector | Scales the light function projection.  X and Y scale in the directions perpendicular to the light's direction, Z scales along the light direction. |  |
| IESTexture | UTextureLightProfile * | IES texture (light profiles from real world measured data) |  |
| bUseIESBrightness | uint32 | true: take light brightness from IES profile, false: use the light brightness - the maximum light in one direction is used to define no masking. Use with InverseSquareFalloff. Will be disabled if a valid IES profile texture is not supplied. |  |
| IESBrightnessScale | float | Global scale for IES brightness contribution. Only available when "Use IES Brightness" is selected, and a valid IES profile texture is set |  |
| LightFunctionFadeDistance | float | Distance at which the light function should be completely faded to DisabledBrightness.  <br>	  This is useful for hiding aliasing from light functions applied in the distance. |  |
| DisabledBrightness | float | Brightness factor applied to the light when the light function is specified but disabled, for example in scene captures that use SceneCapView_LitNoShadows. <br>	  This should be set to the average brightness of the light function material's emissive input, which should be between 0 and 1. |  |
| bEnableLightShaftBloom | uint32 | Whether to render light shaft bloom from this light. <br>	  For directional lights, the color around the light direction will be blurred radially and added back to the scene.<br>	  for point lights, the color on pixels closer than the light's SourceRadius will be blurred radially and added back to the scene. |  |
| BloomScale | float | Scales the additive color. |  |
| BloomThreshold | float | Scene color must be larger than this to create bloom in the light shafts. |  |
| BloomTint | FColor | Multiplies against scene color to create the bloom color. |  |
| bUseRayTracedDistanceFieldShadows | bool | Whether to use ray traced distance field area shadows.  The project setting bGenerateMeshDistanceFields must be enabled for this to have effect.<br>	  Distance field shadows support area lights so they create soft shadows with sharp contacts.  <br>	  They have less aliasing artifacts than standard shadowmaps, but inherit all the limitations of distance field representations (only uniform scale, no deformation).<br>	  These shadows have a low per-object cost (and don't depend on triangle count) so they are effective for distant shadows from a dynamic sun. |  |
| RayStartOffsetDepthScale | float | Controls how large of an offset ray traced shadows have from the receiving surface as the camera gets further away.  <br>	  This can be useful to hide self-shadowing artifacts from low resolution distance fields on huge static meshes. |  |
