## Description

Physical materials are used to define the response of a physical object when interacting dynamically with the world.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Friction | float | Friction value of surface, controls how easily things can slide on this surface (0 is frictionless, higher values increase the amount of friction) |  |
| FrictionCombineMode | TEnumAsByte < EFrictionCombineMode :: Type > | Friction combine mode, controls how friction is computed for multiple materials. |  |
| bOverrideFrictionCombineMode | bool | If set we will use the FrictionCombineMode of this material, instead of the FrictionCombineMode found in the project settings. |  |
| Restitution | float | Restitution or 'bounciness' of this surface, between 0 (no bounce) and 1 (outgoing velocity is same as incoming). |  |
| RestitutionCombineMode | TEnumAsByte < EFrictionCombineMode :: Type > | Restitution combine mode, controls how restitution is computed for multiple materials. |  |
| bOverrideRestitutionCombineMode | bool | If set we will use the RestitutionCombineMode of this material, instead of the RestitutionCombineMode found in the project settings. |  |
| Density | float | Used with the shape of the object to calculate its mass properties. The higher the number, the heavier the object. g per cubic cm. |  |
| RaiseMassToPower | float | Used to adjust the way that mass increases as objects get larger. This is applied to the mass as calculated based on a 'solid' object. <br>	 	In actuality, larger objects do not tend to be solid, and become more like 'shells' (e.g. a car is not a solid piece of metal).<br>	 	Values are clamped to 1 or less. |  |
| DestructibleDamageThresholdScale | float | How much to scale the damage threshold by on any destructible we are applied to |  |
| PhysicalMaterialProperty | UDEPRECATED_PhysicalMaterialPropertyBase * | UPROPERTY(deprecated) |  |
| SurfaceType | TEnumAsByte < EPhysicalSurface > | To edit surface type for your project, use ProjectSettingsPhysicsPhysicalSurface section |  |
| TireFrictionScale | float | DEPRECATED - Overall tire friction scalar for every type of tire. This value is multiplied against our parents' values. |  |
| TireFrictionScales | TArray < FTireFrictionScalePair > | DEPRECATED - Tire friction scales for specific types of tires. These values are multiplied against our parents' values. |  |
