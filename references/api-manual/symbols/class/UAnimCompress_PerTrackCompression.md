## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MaxZeroingThreshold | float | Maximum threshold to use when replacing a component with zero. Lower values retain more keys, but yield less compression. |  |
| MaxPosDiffBitwise | float | Maximum position difference to use when testing if an animation key may be removed. Lower values retain more keys, but yield less compression. |  |
| MaxAngleDiffBitwise | float | Maximum angle difference to use when testing if an animation key may be removed. Lower values retain more keys, but yield less compression. |  |
| MaxScaleDiffBitwise | float | Maximum position difference to use when testing if an animation key may be removed. Lower values retain more keys, but yield less compression. |  |
| AllowedRotationFormats | TArray < TEnumAsByte < enum AnimationCompressionFormat > > | Which encoding formats is the per-track compressor allowed to try on rotation keys |  |
| AllowedTranslationFormats | TArray < TEnumAsByte < enum AnimationCompressionFormat > > | Which encoding formats is the per-track compressor allowed to try on translation keys |  |
| AllowedScaleFormats | TArray < TEnumAsByte < enum AnimationCompressionFormat > > | Which encoding formats is the per-track compressor allowed to try on scale keys |  |
| bResampleAnimation | uint32 | If true, resample the animation to ResampleFramerate frames per second |  |
| ResampledFramerate | float | When bResampleAnimation is true, this defines the desired framerate |  |
| MinKeysForResampling | int32 | Animations with fewer keys than MinKeysForResampling will not be resampled. |  |
| bUseAdaptiveError | uint32 | If true, adjust the error thresholds based on the 'height' within the skeleton |  |
| bUseOverrideForEndEffectors | uint32 | If true, uses MinEffectorDiff as the threhsold for end effectors |  |
| TrackHeightBias | int32 | A bias added to the track height before using it to calculate the adaptive error |  |
| ParentingDivisor | float | Reduces the error tolerance the further up the tree that a key occurs<br>	  EffectiveErrorTolerance = Max(BaseErrorTolerance  Power(ParentingDivisor, Max(Height+Bias,0)  ParentingDivisorExponent), ZeroingThreshold)<br>	  Only has an effect bUseAdaptiveError is true |  |
| ParentingDivisorExponent | float | Reduces the error tolerance the further up the tree that a key occurs<br>	  EffectiveErrorTolerance = Max(BaseErrorTolerance  Power(ParentingDivisor, Max(Height+Bias,0)  ParentingDivisorExponent), ZeroingThreshold)<br>	  Only has an effect bUseAdaptiveError is true |  |
| bUseAdaptiveError2 | uint32 | If true, the adaptive error system will determine how much error to allow for each track, based on the<br>	  error introduced in end effectors due to errors in the track. |  |
| RotationErrorSourceRatio | float | This ratio determines how much error in end effector rotation can come from a given track's rotation error or translation error.<br>	  If 1, all of it must come from rotation error, if 0.5, half can come from each, and if 0.0, all must come from translation error. |  |
| TranslationErrorSourceRatio | float | This ratio determines how much error in end effector translation can come from a given track's rotation error or translation error.<br>	  If 1, all of it must come from rotation error, if 0.5, half can come from each, and if 0.0, all must come from translation error. |  |
| ScaleErrorSourceRatio | float | This ratio determines how much error in end effector scale can come from a given track's rotation error or scale error.<br>	  If 1, all of it must come from rotation error, if 0.5, half can come from each, and if 0.0, all must come from scale error. |  |
| MaxErrorPerTrackRatio | float | A fraction that determines how much of the total error budget can be introduced by any particular track |  |
| PerturbationProbeSize | float | How big of a perturbation should be made when probing error propagation |  |
