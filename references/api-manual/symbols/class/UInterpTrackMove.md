## Description

Track containing data for moving an actor around over time.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PosTrack | FInterpCurveVector | Actual position keyframe data. |  |
| EulerTrack | FInterpCurveVector | Actual rotation keyframe data, stored as Euler angles in degrees, for easy editing on curve. |  |
| LookupTrack | FInterpLookupTrack |  |  |
| LookAtGroupName | FName | When using IMR_LookAtGroup, specifies the Group which this track should always point its actor at. |  |
| LinCurveTension | float | Controls the tightness of the curve for the translation path. |  |
| AngCurveTension | float | Controls the tightness of the curve for the rotation path. |  |
| bUseQuatInterpolation | uint32 | Use a Quaternion linear interpolation between keys.<br>	 	This is robust and will find the 'shortest' distance between keys, but does not support ease inout. |  |
| bShowArrowAtKeys | uint32 | In the editor, show a small arrow at each keyframe indicating the rotation at that key. |  |
| bDisableMovement | uint32 | Disable previewing of this track - will always position  AActor  at Time=0.0. Useful when keyframing an object relative to this group. |  |
| bShowTranslationOnCurveEd | uint32 | If false, when this track is displayed on the Curve Editor in Matinee, do not show the Translation tracks. |  |
| bShowRotationOnCurveEd | uint32 | If false, when this track is displayed on the Curve Editor in Matinee, do not show the Rotation tracks. |  |
| bHide3DTrack | uint32 | If true, 3D representation of this track in the 3D viewport is disabled. |  |
| RotMode | TEnumAsByte < enum EInterpTrackMoveRotMode > |  |  |
