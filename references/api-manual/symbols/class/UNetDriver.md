## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NetConnectionClassName | FString | Used to specify the class to use for connections |  |
| MaxDownloadSize | int32 | @todo document |  |
| bClampListenServerTickRate | uint32 | @todo document |  |
| NetServerMaxTickRate | int32 | @todo document |  |
| MaxInternetClientRate | int32 | @todo document |  |
| MaxClientRate | int32 | @todo document |  |
| ServerTravelPause | float | Amount of time a server will wait before traveling to next map, gives clients time to receive final RPCs on existing level @see NextSwitchCountdown |  |
| SpawnPrioritySeconds | float | @todo document |  |
| RelevantTimeout | float | @todo document |  |
| KeepAliveTime | float | @todo document |  |
| InitialConnectTimeout | float | Amount of time to wait for a new net connection to be established before destroying the connection |  |
| IgnoreNetReadyReplicateActorCount | int32 | Number of prioritized actors which should ignore IsNetReady when gets replicated |  |
| ConnectionTimeout | float | Amount of time to wait before considering an established connection timed out.<br>	  Typically shorter than the time to wait on a new connection because this connection<br>	  should already have been setup and any interruption should be trapped quicker. |  |
| TimeoutMultiplierForUnoptimizedBuilds | float | A multiplier that is applied to the above values when we are running with unoptimized builds (debug)<br>	 or data (uncooked). This allows us to retain normal timeout behavior while debugging without resorting<br>	 to the nuclear 'notimeouts' option or bumping the values above. If ==0 multiplier = 1 |  |
| bNoTimeouts | bool | If true, ignore timeouts completely.  Should be used only in development |  |
| SimpleRepClassConfig | TArray < FString > |  |  |
| ServerConnection | UNetConnection * | Connection to the server (this net driver is a client) |  |
| ClientConnections | TArray < UNetConnection * > | Array of connections to clients (this net driver is a host) |  |
| World | UWorld * | World this net driver is associated with |  |
| NetConnectionClass | UClass * | The loaded UClass of the net connection type to use |  |
| RoleProperty | UProperty * | @todo document |  |
| RemoteRoleProperty | UProperty * | @todo document |  |
| NetDriverName | FName | Used to specify the net driver to filter actors with (NAME_None || NAME_GameNetDriver is the default net driver) |  |
| Time | float | Accumulated time for the net driver, updated by Tick |  |
| bOpenClientClampDriverDeltaTime | bool |  |  |
| ClientClampDriverDeltaTimeMin | float |  |  |
| ClientClampDriverDeltaTimeMax | float |  |  |
| NeedResendSubObjectCreateOrRemoveInfoClassConfiges | TArray < FString > |  |  |
