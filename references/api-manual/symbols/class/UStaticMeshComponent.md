## Description

StaticMeshComponent is used to create an instance of a UStaticMesh.
  A static mesh is a piece of geometry that consists of a static set of polygons.
 
  @see UStaticMesh

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ForcedLodModel | int32 | If 0, auto-select LOD level. if >0, force to (ForcedLodModel-1). |  |
| PreviousLODLevel | int32 | LOD that was desired for rendering this StaticMeshComponent last frame. |  |
| MinLOD | int32 | Specifies the smallest LOD that will be used for this component.<br>	  This is ignored if ForcedLodModel is enabled. |  |

| StaticMesh | UStaticMesh * | The static mesh that this component uses to render |  |
| TightBoundsOrigin | FVector |  |  |
| TightBoundsBoxExtent | FVector |  |  |
| TightBoundsSphereRadius | float |  |  |
| CanUseTightBound | bool |  |  |
| VisibilityCollisionColor | FColor | Whether you want to turn on the collision display preview |  |
| bEnableSimpleMaterial | bool | If true, WireframeColorOverride will be used. If false, color is determined based on mobility and physics simulation settings |  |
| bOverrideWireframeColor | uint8 | If true, WireframeColorOverride will be used. If false, color is determined based on mobility and physics simulation settings |  |
| bOverrideMinLOD | uint8 | Whether to override the MinLOD setting of the static mesh asset with the MinLOD of this component. |  |
| bOverrideNavigationExport | uint8 | If true, bForceNavigationObstacle flag will take priority over navigation data stored in StaticMesh |  |
| bForceNavigationObstacle | uint8 | Allows overriding navigation export behavior per component: full collisions or dynamic obstacle |  |
| bDisallowMeshPaintPerInstance | uint8 | If true, mesh painting is disallowed on this instance. Set if vertex colors are overridden in a construction script. |  |
| bIgnoreInstanceForTextureStreaming | uint8 | Ignore this instance of this static mesh when calculating streaming information.<br>	 	This can be useful when doing things like applying character textures to static geometry,<br>	 	to avoid them using distance-based streaming. |  |
| bOverrideLightMapRes | uint8 | Whether to override the lightmap resolution defined in the static mesh. |  |
| bOverrideCullingScreenSize | uint8 |  |  |
| bCastDistanceFieldIndirectShadow | uint8 | Whether to use the mesh distance field representation (when present) for shadowing indirect lighting (from lightmaps or skylight) on Movable components.<br>	  This works like capsule shadows on skeletal meshes, except using the mesh distance field so no physics asset is required.<br>	  The StaticMesh must have 'Generate Mesh Distance Field' enabled, or the project must have 'Generate Mesh Distance Fields' enabled for this feature to work. |  |
| bOverrideDistanceFieldSelfShadowBias | uint8 | Whether to override the DistanceFieldSelfShadowBias setting of the static mesh asset with the DistanceFieldSelfShadowBias of this component. |  |

| StreamingDistanceMultiplier | float | Allows adjusting the desired streaming distance of streaming textures that uses UV 0.<br>	  1.0 is the default, whereas a higher value makes the textures stream in sooner from far away.<br>	  A lower value (0.0-1.0) makes the textures stream in later (you have to be closer).<br>	  Value can be < 0 (from legcay content, or code changes) |  |
| LODData | TArray < FStaticMeshComponentLODInfo > | Static mesh LOD data.  Contains static lighting data along with instanced mesh vertex colors. |  |
| StreamingTextureData | TArray < FStreamingTextureBuildInfo > | The list of texture, bounds and scales. As computed in the texture streaming build process. |  |

| SelectedEditorMaterial | int32 | The material currently selected in the Editor. Used for highlighting |  |
| SectionIndexPreview | int32 | Index of the section to preview. If set to INDEX_NONE, all section will be rendered. Used for isolating in Static Mesh Tool |  |
| MaterialIndexPreview | int32 | Index of the material to preview. If set to INDEX_NONE, all section will be rendered. Used for isolating in Static Mesh Tool |  |
| StaticMeshImportVersion | int32 | The import version of the static mesh when it was assign this is update when:<br>	  - The user assign a new staticmesh to the component<br>	  - The component is serialize (IsSaving)<br>	  - Default value is BeforeImportStaticMeshVersionWasAdded<br>	 <br>	  If when the component get load (PostLoad) the version of the attach staticmesh is newer<br>	  then this value, we will remap the material override because the order of the materials list<br>	  in the staticmesh can be changed. Hopefully there is a remap table save in the staticmesh. |  |
| bCustomOverrideVertexColorPerLOD | uint8 | The component has some custom painting on LODs or not. |  |
| bDisplayVertexColors | uint8 |  |  |
| DistanceFieldIndirectShadowMinVisibility | float | Controls how dark the dynamic indirect shadow can be. |  |
