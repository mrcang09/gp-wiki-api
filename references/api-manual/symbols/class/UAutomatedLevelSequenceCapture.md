## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LevelSequenceAsset | FSoftObjectPath | A level sequence asset to playback at runtime - used where the level sequence does not already exist in the world. |  |
| bUseCustomStartFrame | bool | When enabled, the StartFrame setting will override the default starting frame number |  |
| StartFrame | int32 | Frame number to start capturing.  The frame number range depends on whether the bUseRelativeFrameNumbers option is enabled. |  |
| bUseCustomEndFrame | bool | When enabled, the EndFrame setting will override the default ending frame number |  |
| EndFrame | int32 | Frame number to end capturing.  The frame number range depends on whether the bUseRelativeFrameNumbers option is enabled. |  |
| WarmUpFrameCount | int32 | The number of extra frames to play before the sequence's start frame, to "warm up" the animation.  This is useful if your<br>	    animation contains particles or other runtime effects that are spawned into the scene earlier than your capture start frame |  |
| DelayBeforeWarmUp | float | The number of seconds to wait (in real-time) before we start playing back the warm up frames.  Useful for allowing post processing effects to settle down before capturing the animation. |  |
| BurnInOptions | ULevelSequenceBurnInOptions * |  |  |
| bWriteEditDecisionList | bool | Whether to write edit decision lists (EDLs) if the sequence contains shots |  |
| LevelSequenceActor | TWeakObjectPtr < ALevelSequenceActor > | The pre-existing level sequence actor to use for capture that specifies playback settings |  |
