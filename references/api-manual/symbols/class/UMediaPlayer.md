## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CacheAhead | FTimespan | Duration of samples to cache ahead of the play head.<br>	 <br>	  @see CacheBehind, CacheBehindGame |  |
| CacheBehind | FTimespan | Duration of samples to cache behind the play head (when not running as game).<br>	 <br>	  @see CacheAhead, CacheBehindGame |  |
| CacheBehindGame | FTimespan | Duration of samples to cache behind the play head (when running as game).<br>	 <br>	  @see CacheAhead, CacheBehind |  |
| NativeAudioOut | bool | Output any audio via the operating system's sound mixer instead of a Sound Wave asset.<br>	 <br>	  If enabled, the assigned Sound Wave asset will be ignored. The SetNativeVolume<br>	  function can then be used to change the audio output volume at runtime. Note that<br>	  not all media player plug-ins may support native audio output on all platforms.<br>	 <br>	  @see SetNativeVolume |  |
| PlayOnOpen | bool | Automatically start playback after media opened successfully.<br>	 <br>	  If disabled, listen to the OnMediaOpened Blueprint event to detect when<br>	  the media finished opening, and then start playback using the Play function.<br>	 <br>	  @see OpenFile, OpenPlaylist, OpenPlaylistIndex, OpenSource, OpenUrl, Play |  |
| Shuffle | uint32 | Whether playback should shuffle media sources in the play list.<br>	 <br>	  @see OpenPlaylist, OpenPlaylistIndex |  |
| Loop | uint32 | Whether the player should loop when media playback reaches the end.<br>	 <br>	  Use the SetLooping function to change this value at runtime.<br>	 <br>	  @see IsLooping, SetLooping |  |

| HorizontalFieldOfView | float | The initial horizontal field of view (in Euler degrees; default = 90).<br>	 <br>	  This setting is used only for 360 videos. It determines the portion of the<br>	  video that is visible at a time. To modify the field of view at runtime in<br>	  Blueprints, use the SetHorizontalFieldOfView function.<br>	 <br>	  @see GetHorizontalFieldOfView, SetHorizontalFieldOfView, VerticalFieldOfView, ViewRotation |  |
| VerticalFieldOfView | float | The initial vertical field of view (in Euler degrees; default = 60).<br>	 <br>	  This setting is used only for 360 videos. It determines the portion of the<br>	  video that is visible at a time. To modify the field of view at runtime in<br>	  Blueprints, use the SetHorizontalFieldOfView function.<br>	 <br>	  Please note that some 360 video players may be able to change only the<br>	  horizontal field of view, and this setting may be ignored.<br>	 <br>	  @see GetVerticalFieldOfView, SetVerticalFieldOfView, HorizontalFieldOfView, ViewRotation |  |
| ViewRotation | FRotator | The initial view rotation.<br>	 <br>	  This setting is used only for 360 videos. It determines the rotation of<br>	  the video's view.
