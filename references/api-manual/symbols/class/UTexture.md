| SourceFilePath_DEPRECATED | FString |  |  |
| AssetImportData | UAssetImportData * |  |  |
| AdjustBrightness | float | Static texture brightness adjustment (scales HSV value.)  (Non-destructive; Requires texture source art to be available.) |  |
| AdjustBrightnessCurve | float | Static texture curve adjustment (raises HSV value to the specified power.)  (Non-destructive; Requires texture source art to be available.) |  |
| AdjustVibrance | float | Static texture "vibrance" adjustment (0 - 1) (HSV saturation algorithm adjustment.)  (Non-destructive; Requires texture source art to be available.) |  |
| AdjustSaturation | float | Static texture saturation adjustment (scales HSV saturation.)  (Non-destructive; Requires texture source art to be available.) |  |
| AdjustRGBCurve | float | Static texture RGB curve adjustment (raises linear-space RGB color to the specified power.)  (Non-destructive; Requires texture source art to be available.) |  |
| AdjustHue | float | Static texture hue adjustment (0 - 360) (offsets HSV hue by value in degrees.)  (Non-destructive; Requires texture source art to be available.) |  |
| AdjustMinAlpha | float | Remaps the alpha to the specified minmax range, defines the new value of 0 (Non-destructive; Requires texture source art to be available.) |  |
| AdjustMaxAlpha | float | Remaps the alpha to the specified minmax range, defines the new value of 1 (Non-destructive; Requires texture source art to be available.) |  |
| CompressionNoAlpha | uint32 | If enabled, the texture's alpha channel will be discarded during compression |  |
| CompressionNone | uint32 |  |  |
| DeferCompression | uint32 | If enabled, defer compression of the texture until save. |  |
| MaxTextureSize | int32 | The maximum resolution for generated textures. A value of 0 means the maximum size for the format on each platform, except HDR longlat cubemaps, which default to a resolution of 512. |  |
| MaxTextureSizeHD | int32 |  |  |
| MaxTextureSizeWinOB | int32 |  |  |
| MaxTextureSizePC | int32 |  |  |
| CompressionQuality | TEnumAsByte < enum ETextureCompressionQuality > | The compression quality for generated textures. |  |
| bDitherMipMapAlpha | uint32 | When true, the alpha channel of mip-maps and the base image are dithered for smooth LOD transitions. |  |
| AlphaCoverageThresholds | FVector4 | Alpha values per channel to compare to when preserving alpha coverage. |  |
| bPreserveBorder | uint32 | When true the texture's border will be preserved during mipmap generation. |  |
| bFlipGreenChannel | uint32 | When true the texture's green channel will be inverted. This is useful for some normal maps. |  |
| bForcePVRTC4 | uint32 | For DXT1 textures, setting this will cause the texture to be twice the size, but better looking, on iPhone |  |
| PowerOfTwoMode | TEnumAsByte < enum ETexturePowerOfTwoSetting :: Type > | How to pad the texture to a power of 2 size (if necessary) |  |
| PaddingColor | FColor | The color used to pad the texture out if it is resized due to PowerOfTwoMode |  |
| bChromaKeyTexture | bool | Whether to chroma key the image, replacing any pixels that match ChromaKeyColor with transparent black |  |
| ChromaKeyThreshold | float | The threshold that components have to match for the texel to be considered equal to the ChromaKeyColor when chroma keying (<=, set to 0 to require a perfect exact match) |  |
| ChromaKeyColor | FColor | The color that will be replaced with transparent black if chroma keying is enabled |  |
| MipGenSettings | TEnumAsByte < enum TextureMipGenSettings > | Per asset specific setting to define the mip-map generation properties like sharpening and kernel size. |  |
| bUseNewFilter_UE4 | bool | New Tex Mip Filter  Tex MaxSize Filter from UE5 |  |
| CompositeTexture | UTexture * | Can be defined to modify the roughness based on the normal map variation (mostly from mip maps).<br>	  MaxAlpha comes in handy to define a base roughness if no source alpha was there.<br>	  Make sure the normal map has at least as many mips as this texture. |  |
| CompositeTextureMode | TEnumAsByte < enum ECompositeTextureMode > | defines how the CompositeTexture is applied, e.g. CTM_RoughnessFromNormalAlpha |  |
| CompositePower | float | default 1, high values result in a stronger effect e.g 1, 2, 4, 8<br>	  this is no slider because the texture update would not be fast enough |  |
| bIsCookingHDTexture | bool |  |  |
| bIsCookingPCTexture | bool |  |  |
| bUseLegacyGamma | uint32 | A flag for using the simplified legacy gamma space e.g pow(color,12.2) for converting from FColor to FLinearColor, if we're doing sRGB. |  |
