## Description

Allows multiple animations to be blended between based on input parameters

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bRotationBlendInMeshSpace | bool | When you use blend per bone, allows rotation to blend in mesh space. This only works if this does not contain additive animation samples<br>	 This is more performance intensive |  |
| AnimLength | float | This animation length changes based on current input (resulting in different blend time) |  |
| InterpolationParam | FInterpolationParameter | Input interpolation parameter for all 3 axis, for each axis input, decide how you'd like to interpolate input to |  |
| TargetWeightInterpolationSpeedPerSec | float | Target weight interpolation. When target samples are set, how fast you'd like to get to target. Improve target blending.<br>	 i.e. for locomotion, if you interpolate input, when you move from left to right rapidly, you'll interpolate through forward, but if you use target weight interpolation,<br>	 you'll skip forward, but interpolate between left to right |  |
| NotifyTriggerMode | TEnumAsByte < ENotifyTriggerMode :: Type > | The current mode used by the blendspace to decide which animation notifies to fire. Valid options are: |  |
| PerBoneBlend | TArray < FPerBoneInterpolation > | Define target weight interpolation per bone. This will blend in different speed per each bone setting |  |
| SampleIndexWithMarkers | int32 | Track index to get marker data from. Samples are tested for the suitability of marker based sync<br>	    during load and if we can use marker based sync we cache an index to a representative sample here |  |
| SampleData | TArray < struct FBlendSample > | Sample animation data |  |
| GridSamples | TArray < struct FEditorElement > | Grid samples, indexing scheme imposed by subclass |  |
| BlendParameters | FBlendParameter | Blend Parameters for each axis. |  |
