## Description

Characters are Pawns that have a mesh, collision, and built-in movement logic.
  They are responsible for all physical interaction between the player or AI and the world, and also implement basic networking and input models.
  They are designed for a vertically-oriented player representation that can walk, jump, fly, and swim through the world using CharacterMovementComponent.
 
  @see APawn, UCharacterMovementComponent

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mesh | USkeletalMeshComponent * | The main skeletal mesh associated with this Character (optional sub-object). |  |
| CharacterMovement | UCharacterMovementComponent * | Movement component used for movement logic in various movement modes (walking, falling, etc), containing relevant settings and functions to control movement. |  |
| CapsuleComponent | UCapsuleComponent * | The CapsuleComponent being used for movement collision (by CharacterMovement). Always treated as being vertically aligned in simple collision check functions. |  |
| BasedMovement | FBasedMovementInfo | Info about our current movement base (object we are standing on). |  |
| ReplicatedBasedMovement | FBasedMovementInfo | Replicated version of relative movement. Read-only on simulated proxies! |  |
| AnimRootMotionTranslationScale | float | Scale to apply to root motion translation on this Character |  |
| NetworkPredictionInterface | TScriptInterface < INetworkPredictionInterface > |  |  |
| BaseTranslationOffset | FVector | Saved translation offset of mesh. |  |
| BaseRotationOffset | FQuat | Saved rotation offset of mesh. |  |
| ReplicatedServerLastTransformUpdateTimeStamp | float | CharacterMovement ServerLastTransformUpdateTimeStamp value, replicated to simulated proxies. |  |
| ReplicatedMovementMode | uint8 | Flag that we are receiving replication of the based movement. |  |
| bInBaseReplication | bool | Flag that we are receiving replication of the based movement. |  |
| CrouchedEyeHeight | float | Default crouched eye height |  |
| bIsCrouched | uint32 | Set by character movement to specify that this Character is currently crouched. |  |
| bPressedJump | uint32 | When true, player wants to jump |  |
| bClientUpdating | uint32 | When true, applying updates to network client (replaying saved moves for a locally controlled character) |  |
| bClientWasFalling | uint32 | True if Pawn was initially falling when started to replay network moves. |  |
| bClientResimulateRootMotion | uint32 | If server disagrees with root motion track position, client has to resimulate root motion from last AckedMove. |  |
| bClientResimulateRootMotionSources | uint32 | If server disagrees with root motion state, client has to resimulate root motion from last AckedMove. |  |
| bSimGravityDisabled | uint32 | Disable simulated gravity (set when character encroaches geometry on client, to keep him from falling through floors) |  |
| bClientCheckEncroachmentOnNetUpdate | uint32 |  |  |
| bServerMoveIgnoreRootMotion | uint32 | Disable root motion on the server. When receiving a DualServerMove, where the first move is not root motion and the second is. |  |
| JumpKeyHoldTime | float | Jump key Held Time.<br>	  This is the time that the player has held the jump key, in seconds. |  |
| JumpMaxHoldTime | float | The max time the jump key can be held.<br>	  Note that if StopJumping() is not called before the max jump hold time is reached,<br>	  then the character will carry on receiving vertical velocity. Therefore it is usually <br>	  best to call StopJumping() when jump input has ceased (such as a button up event). |  |
| JumpMaxCount | int32 | The max number of jumps the character can perform.<br>      Note that if JumpMaxHoldTime is non zero and StopJumping is not called, the player<br>      may be able to perform and unlimited number of jumps. Therefore it is usually<br>      best to call StopJumping() when jump input has ceased (such as a button up event). |  |
| JumpCurrentCount | int32 | Tracks the current number of jumps performed.<br>      This is incremented in CheckJumpInput, used in CanJump_Implementation, and reset in OnMovementModeChanged.<br>      When providing overrides for these methods, it's recommended to either manually<br>      increment  reset this value, or call the Super:: method. |  |
| bWasJumping | uint32 |  |  |
| bUseReplaySampleRot | uint32 |  |  |
| SavedRootMotion | FRootMotionSourceGroup | For LocallyControlled Autonomous clients. <br>	   During a PerformMovement() after root motion is prepared, we save it off into this and<br>	   then record it into our SavedMoves.<br>	   During SavedMove playback we use it as our "Previous Move" SavedRootMotion which includes<br>	   last received root motion from the Server |  |
| ClientRootMotionParams | FRootMotionMovementParams | For LocallyControlled Autonomous clients. Saved root motion data to be used by SavedMoves. |  |

### Jump

Make the character jump on the next update.	 
	  If you want your character to jump according to the time that the jump key is held,
	  then you can set JumpKeyHoldTime to some non-zero value. Make sure in this case to
	  call StopJumping() when you want the jump's z-velocity to stop being applied (such 
	  as on a button up event), otherwise the character will carry on receiving the 
	  velocity until JumpKeyHoldTime is reached.

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void |  |  |

### StopJumping

Stop the character from jumping on the next update. 
	  Call this from an input event (such as a button 'up' event) to cease applying
	  jump Z-velocity. If this is not called, then jump z-velocity will be applied
	  until JumpMaxHoldTime is reached.

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void |  |  |

### CanJump

	  Default implementation also allows for 'hold to jump higher' functionality: 
	  As well as returning true when on the ground, it also returns true when GetMaxJumpTime is more
	  than zero and IsJumping returns true.

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
