## Functions

### SetSkeletalMeshComponent

Sets the skeletal mesh we are driving through physical animation. Will erase any existing physical animation data.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InSkeletalMeshComponent | USkeletalMeshComponent * |  |  |

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | void  |  |  |

### ApplyPhysicalAnimationSettings

Applies the physical animation settings to the body given.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BodyName | FName  |  |  |
| PhysicalAnimationData | FPhysicalAnimationData & |  |  |

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |

|  | void  |  |  |

### ApplyPhysicalAnimationSettingsBelow

Applies the physical animation settings to the body given and all bodies below.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BodyName | FName  |  |  |
| PhysicalAnimationData | FPhysicalAnimationData &  |  |  |
| bIncludeSelf | bool |  |  |

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |

### SetStrengthMultiplyer

Updates strength multiplyer and any active motors

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InStrengthMultiplyer | float |  |  |

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### ApplyPhysicalAnimationProfileBelow

Applies the physical animation profile to the body given and all bodies below.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BodyName | FName  |  The body from which we'd like to start applying the physical animation profile. Finds all bodies below in the skeleton hierarchy. None implies all bodies |  |
| ProfileName | FName  | The physical animation profile we'd like to apply. For each body in the physics asset we search for physical animation settings with this name. |  |
| bIncludeSelf | bool  | Whether to include the provided body name in the list of bodies we act on (useful to ignore for cases where a root has multiple children) |  |
| bClearNotFound | bool | If true, bodies without the given profile name will have any existing physical animation settings cleared. If false, bodies without the given profile name are left untouched. |  |
