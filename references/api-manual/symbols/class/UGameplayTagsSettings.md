## Description

Class for importing GameplayTags directly from a config file.
 	FGameplayTagsEditorModule::StartupModule adds this class to the Project Settings menu to be edited.
 	Editing this in Project Settings will output changes to ConfigDefaultGameplayTags.ini.
 	
 	Primary advantages of this approach are:
 	-Adding new tags doesn't require checking out external and editing file (CSV or xls) then reimporting.
 	-New tags are mergeable since .ini are text and non exclusive checkout.
 	
 	To do:
 	-Better support could be added for adding new tags. We could match existing tags and autocomplete subtags as
 	the user types (e.g, autocomplete 'Damage.Physical' as the user is adding a 'Damage.Physical.Slash' tag).

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ImportTagsFromConfig | bool | If true, will import tags from ini files in the configtags folder |  |
| WarnOnInvalidTags | bool | If true, will give load warnings when reading invalid tags off disk |  |
| InvalidTagCharacters | FString | These characters cannot be used in gameplay tags, in addition to special ones like newline |  |
| CategoryRemapping | TArray < FGameplayTagCategoryRemap > |  |  |
| FastReplication | bool | If true, will replicate gameplay tags by index instead of name. For this to work, tags must be identical on client and server |  |
| GameplayTagTableList | TArray < FSoftObjectPath > | List of data tables to load tags from |  |
| GameplayTagRedirects | TArray < FGameplayTagRedirect > | List of active tag redirects |  |
| CommonlyReplicatedTags | TArray < FName > | List of tags most frequently replicated |  |
| NumBitsForContainerSize | int32 | Numbers of bits to use for replicating container size, set this based on how large your containers tend to be |  |
| NetIndexFirstBitSegment | int32 | The length in bits of the first segment when net serializing tags. We will serialize NetIndexFirstBitSegment + 1 bit to indicate "more", which is slower to replicate |  |
| GameplayTagDontNeedFastReplicationList | TArray < FName > |  |  |
