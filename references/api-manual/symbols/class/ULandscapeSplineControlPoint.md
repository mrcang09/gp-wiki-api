## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Location | FVector | Location in Landscape-space |  |
| Rotation | FRotator | Rotation of tangent vector at this point (in landscape-space) |  |
| Width | float | Width of the spline at this point. |  |
| SideFalloff | float | Falloff at the sides of the spline at this point. |  |
| EndFalloff | float | Falloff at the startend of the spline (if this point is a start or end point, otherwise ignored). |  |
| ConnectedSegments | TArray < FLandscapeSplineConnection > |  |  |
| Points | TArray < FLandscapeSplineInterpPoint > | Spline points |  |
| Bounds | FBox | Bounds of points |  |
| LocalMeshComponent | UControlPointMeshComponent * | Control point mesh |  |
| SegmentMeshOffset | float | Vertical offset of the spline segment mesh. Useful for a river's surface, among other things. |  |
| LayerName | FName | Name of blend layer to paint when applying spline to landscape<br>	  If "none", no layer is painted |  |
| bRaiseTerrain | uint32 | If the spline is above the terrain, whether to raise the terrain up to the level of the spline when applying it to the landscape. |  |
| bLowerTerrain | uint32 | If the spline is below the terrain, whether to lower the terrain down to the level of the spline when applying it to the landscape. |  |
| Mesh | UStaticMesh * | Mesh to use on the control point |  |
| MaterialOverrides | TArray < UMaterialInterface * > | Overrides mesh's materials |  |
| MeshScale | FVector | Scale of the control point mesh |  |
| bEnableCollision | uint32 | Whether to enable collision for the Control Point Mesh. |  |
| bCastShadow | uint32 | Whether the Control Point Mesh should cast a shadow. |  |
| LDMaxDrawDistance | float | Max draw distance for the mesh used on this control point |  |
| TranslucencySortPriority | int32 | Translucent objects with a lower sort priority draw behind objects with a higher priority.<br>	  Translucent objects with the same priority are rendered from back-to-front based on their bounds origin.<br>	 <br>	  Ignored if the object is not translucent.  The default priority is zero.<br>	  Warning: This should never be set to a non-default value unless you know what you are doing, as it will prevent the renderer from sorting correctly. |  |
| bPlaceSplineMeshesInStreamingLevels | uint32 | Whether control point mesh should be placed in landscape proxy streaming level (true) or the spline's level (false) |  |
| bRenderToTerrainVirtualTexture | uint8 | This spline will be rendered to terrain VT if true |  |
| TerrainRVTRenderSortPriority | int32 | Objects with a lower sort priority draw behind objects with a higher priority.<br>	  Objects with the same priority are rendered from back-to-front based on their bounds origin. |  |
| bSelected | uint32 |  |  |
| bNavDirty | uint32 |  |  |
| ForeignWorld | TSoftObjectPtr < UWorld > | World reference for if mesh component is stored in another streaming level |  |
| ModificationKey | FGuid | Key for tracking whether this segment has been modified relative to the mesh component stored in another streaming level |  |
