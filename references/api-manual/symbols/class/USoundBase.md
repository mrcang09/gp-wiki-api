## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SoundClassObject | USoundClass * | Sound class this sound belongs to |  |
| bDebug | uint32 | When "stat sounds -debug" has been specified, draw this sound's attenuation shape when the sound is audible. For debugging purpose only. |  |
| bOverrideConcurrency | uint32 | Whether or not to override the sound concurrency object with local concurrency settings. |  |
| bOutputToBusOnly | uint32 | Whether or not to only send this audio's output to a bus. If true, will not be this sound won't be audible except through bus sends. |  |
| bIgnoreFocus_DEPRECATED | uint32 |  |  |
| SoundConcurrencySettings | USoundConcurrency * | If Override Concurrency is false, the sound concurrency settings to use for this sound. |  |
| ConcurrencyOverrides | FSoundConcurrencySettings | If Override Concurrency is true, concurrency settings to use. |  |
| MaxConcurrentResolutionRule_DEPRECATED | TEnumAsByte < enum EMaxConcurrentResolutionRule :: Type > |  |  |
| MaxConcurrentPlayCount_DEPRECATED | int32 | Maximum number of times this sound can be played concurrently. |  |
| Duration | float | Duration of sound in seconds. |  |
| AttenuationSettings | USoundAttenuation * | Attenuation settings package for the sound |  |
| Priority | float | Sound priority (higher value is higher priority) used for concurrency resolution. This priority value is weighted against the final volume of the sound. |  |
| SoundSubmixObject | USoundSubmix * | Sound submix this sound belongs to. <br>	   Audio will play here and traverse through the submix graph. <br>	   A null entry will make the sound obey the default master effects graph. |  |
| SoundSubmixSends | TArray < FSoundSubmixSendInfo > | An array of submix sends. Audio from this sound will send a portion of its audio to these effects. |  |
| SourceEffectChain | USoundEffectSourcePresetChain * | The source effect chain to use for this sound. |  |
| BusSends | TArray < FSoundSourceBusSendInfo > | This sound will send it's audio output to this list of buses if there are bus instances playing. |  |
