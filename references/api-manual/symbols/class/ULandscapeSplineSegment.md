## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Connections | FLandscapeSplineSegmentConnection |  |  |
| SplineInfo | FInterpCurveVector | Actual data for spline. |  |
| Points | TArray < FLandscapeSplineInterpPoint > | Spline points |  |
| Bounds | FBox | Bounds of points |  |
| LocalMeshComponents | TArray < USplineMeshComponent * > | Spline meshes |  |
| LayerName | FName | Name of blend layer to paint when applying spline to landscape<br>	  If "none", no layer is painted |  |
| bRaiseTerrain | uint32 | If the spline is above the terrain, whether to raise the terrain up to the level of the spline when applying it to the landscape. |  |
| bLowerTerrain | uint32 | If the spline is below the terrain, whether to lower the terrain down to the level of the spline when applying it to the landscape. |  |
| SplineMeshes | TArray < FLandscapeSplineMeshEntry > | Spline meshes from this list are used in random order along the spline. |  |
| bEnableCollision | uint32 | Whether to generate collision for the Spline Meshes. |  |
| bCastShadow | uint32 | Whether the Spline Meshes should cast a shadow. |  |
| RandomSeed | int32 | Random seed used for choosing which order to use spline meshes. Ignored if only one mesh is set. |  |
| LDMaxDrawDistance | float | Max draw distance for all the mesh pieces used in this spline |  |
| TranslucencySortPriority | int32 | Translucent objects with a lower sort priority draw behind objects with a higher priority.<br>	  Translucent objects with the same priority are rendered from back-to-front based on their bounds origin.<br>	 <br>	  Ignored if the object is not translucent.  The default priority is zero.<br>	  Warning: This should never be set to a non-default value unless you know what you are doing, as it will prevent the renderer from sorting correctly. |  |
| bPlaceSplineMeshesInStreamingLevels | uint32 | Whether spline meshes should be placed in landscape proxy streaming levels (true) or the spline's level (false) |  |
| bRenderToTerrainVirtualTexture | uint8 | This spline will be rendered to terrain VT if true |  |
| TerrainRVTRenderSortPriority | int32 | Objects with a lower sort priority draw behind objects with a higher priority.<br>	  Objects with the same priority are rendered from back-to-front based on their bounds origin. |  |
| bSelected | uint32 |  |  |
| bNavDirty | uint32 |  |  |
| ForeignWorlds | TArray < TSoftObjectPtr < UWorld > > | World references for mesh components stored in other streaming levels |  |
| ModificationKey | FGuid | Key for tracking whether this segment has been modified relative to the mesh components stored in other streaming levels |  |
