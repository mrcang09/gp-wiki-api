## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bDeadTrailsOnDeactivate | uint32 | If true, when the system is deactivated, mark trails as dead.<br>	 	This means they will still render, but will not have more particles<br>	 	added to them, even if the system re-activates... |  |
| bEnablePreviousTangentRecalculation | uint32 | If true, recalculate the previous tangent when a new particle is spawned |  |
| bTangentRecalculationEveryFrame | uint32 | If true, recalculate tangents every frame to allow velocityacceleration to be applied |  |
| TilingDistance | float | The (estimated) covered distance to tile the 2nd UV set at.<br>	 	If 0.0, a second UV set will not be passed in. |  |
| DistanceTessellationStepSize | float | The distance step size for tessellation.<br>	 	# Tessellation Points = TruncToInt((Distance Between Spawned Particles)  DistanceTessellationStepSize)). If 0 then there is no distance tessellation. |  |
| TangentTessellationStepSize | float | The tangent scalar for tessellation.<br>	 	This is the degree change in the tangent direction [0...180] required to warrant an additional tessellation point. If 0 then there is no tangent tessellation. |  |
| WidthTessellationStepSize | float | The width step size for tessellation.<br>	 	This is the number of world units change in the width required to warrant an additional tessellation point. If 0 then there is no width tessellation. |  |
