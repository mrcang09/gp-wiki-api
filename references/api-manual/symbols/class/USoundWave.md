| bLooping | uint32 | If set, when played directly (not through a sound cue) the wave will be played looping. |  |
| bStreaming | uint32 | Whether this sound can be streamed to avoid increased memory usage |  |
| StreamingPriority | int32 | Priority of this sound when streaming (lower priority streams may not always play) |  |
| bMature | uint32 | If set to true if this sound is considered to contain matureadult content. |  |
| bManualWordWrap | uint32 | If set to true will disable automatic generation of line breaks - use if the subtitles have been split manually. |  |
| bSingleLine | uint32 | If set to true the subtitles display as a sequence of single lines as opposed to multiline. |  |
| bVirtualizeWhenSilent | uint32 | Allows sound to play at 0 volume, otherwise will stop the sound when the sound is silent. |  |
| SoundGroup | TEnumAsByte < ESoundGroup > |  |  |
| SpokenText | FString | A localized version of the text that is actually spoken phonetically in the audio. |  |
| SubtitlePriority | float | The priority of the subtitle. |  |
| Volume | float | Playback volume of sound 0 to 1 - Default is 1.0. |  |

| SampleRate | int32 | Cached sample rate for displaying in the tools |  |
| RawPCMDataSize | int32 | Size of RawPCMData, or what RawPCMData would be if the sound was fully decompressed |  |
| Subtitles | TArray < struct FSubtitleCue > | Subtitle cues.  If empty, use SpokenText as the subtitle.  Will often be empty,<br>	  as the contents of the subtitle is commonly identical to what is spoken. |  |
| LocalizedSubtitles | TArray < struct FLocalizedSubtitle > | The array of the subtitles for each language. Generated at cook time. |  |
| Curves | UCurveTable * | Curves associated with this sound wave |  |
| InternalCurves | UCurveTable * | Hold a reference to our internal curve so we can switch back to it if we want to |  |
| ChannelOffsets | TArray < int32 > | Offsets into the bulk data for the source wav data |  |
| ChannelSizes | TArray < int32 > | Sizes of the bulk data for the source wav data |  |
| Comment | FString | Provides contextual information for the sound to the translator. |  |
| SourceFilePath_DEPRECATED | FString |  |  |
