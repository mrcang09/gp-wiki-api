## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| StreamingIndex | int32 | FStreamingTexture index used by the texture streaming system. |  |
| LevelIndex | int32 | Level scope index of this texture. It is used to reduce the amount of lookup to map a texture to its level index.<br>	  Useful when building texture streaming data, as well as when filling the texture streamer with precomputed data.<br>      It relates to FStreamingTextureBuildInfo::TextureLevelIndex and also the index in ULevel::StreamingTextureGuids. <br>	  Default value of -1, indicates that the texture has an unknown index (not yet processed). At level load time, <br>	  -2 is also used to indicate that the texture has been processed but no entry were found in the level table.<br>	  After any of these processes, the LevelIndex is reset to INDEX_NONE. Making it ready for the next level task. |  |
| FirstResourceMemMip | int32 | keep track of first mip level used for ResourceMem creation |  |
| bSuperSamplingMipBiasResponsive | uint32 |  |  |
| PerTextureMipBias | int32 |  |  |
| bUseForTerrainRVT | uint32 |  |  |
| ImportedSize | FIntPoint | The imported size of the texture. Only valid on cooked builds when texture source is not<br>	  available. Access ONLY via the GetImportedSize() accessor! |  |
| ForceMipLevelsToBeResidentTimestamp | double | WorldSettings timestamp that tells the streamer to force all miplevels to be resident up until that time. |  |
| bTemporarilyDisableStreaming | bool | True if streaming is temporarily disabled so we can update subregions of this texture's resource <br>	without streaming clobbering it. Automatically cleared before saving. |  |
| bIsStreamable | bool | Whether the texture is currently streamable or not. |  |
| bHasStreamingUpdatePending | uint32 | Whether some mips might be streamed soon. If false, the texture is not planned resolution will be stable. |  |
| bForceMiplevelsToBeResident | uint32 | Override whether to fully stream even if texture hasn't been rendered. |  |
| bIgnoreStreamingMipBias | uint32 | Ignores the streaming mip bias used to accommodate memory constraints. |  |
| bGlobalForceMipLevelsToBeResident | uint32 | Global and serialized version of ForceMiplevelsToBeResident. |  |
| bIsTransient | uint32 |  |  |
| AddressX | TEnumAsByte < enum TextureAddress > | The addressing mode to use for the X axis. |  |
| AddressY | TEnumAsByte < enum TextureAddress > | The addressing mode to use for the Y axis. |  |
| NotInlineMipCountOverride | uint8 |  |  |
| bHasBeenPaintedInEditor | uint32 | Whether the texture has been painted in the editor. |  |
