UPlanarReflectionComponent

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PreviewBox | UBoxComponent * |  |  |
| NormalDistortionStrength | float | Controls the strength of normals when distorting the planar reflection. |  |
| PrefilterRoughnessY | float | The vertical roughness value to prefilter the planar reflection texture with, useful for hiding low resolution.  Larger values have larger GPU cost. |  |
| PrefilterRoughnessDistanceY | float | The vertical distance at which the prefilter roughness value will be achieved. |  |
| ScreenPercentage | int32 | Downsample percent, can be used to reduce GPU time rendering the planar reflection. |  |
| ExtraFOV | float | Additional FOV used when rendering to the reflection texture.  <br>	  This is useful when normal distortion is causing reads outside the reflection texture. <br>	  Larger values increase rendering thread and GPU cost, as more objects and triangles have to be rendered into the planar reflection. |  |
| DistanceFromPlaneFadeStart_DEPRECATED | float |  |  |
| DistanceFromPlaneFadeEnd_DEPRECATED | float |  |  |
| DistanceFromPlaneFadeoutStart | float | Receiving pixels at this distance from the reflection plane will begin to fade out the planar reflection. |  |
| DistanceFromPlaneFadeoutEnd | float | Receiving pixels at this distance from the reflection plane will have completely faded out the planar reflection. |  |
| AngleFromPlaneFadeStart | float | Receiving pixels whose normal is at this angle from the reflection plane will begin to fade out the planar reflection. |  |
| AngleFromPlaneFadeEnd | float | Receiving pixels whose normal is at this angle from the reflection plane will have completely faded out the planar reflection. |  |
| bRenderSceneTwoSided | bool | Whether to render the scene as two-sided, which can be useful to hide artifacts where normal distortion would read 'under' an object that has been clipped by the reflection plane. <br>	  With this setting enabled, the backfaces of a mesh would be displayed in the clipped region instead of the background which is potentially a bright sky.<br>	  Be sure to add the water plane to HiddenActors if enabling this, as the water plane will now block the reflection. |  |
| bBlurHorizontal | bool | Whether to blur along horizontal direction |  |
| PrefilterRoughnessX | float | The horizontal roughness value to prefilter the planar reflection texture with, useful for hiding low resolution.  Larger values have larger GPU cost. |  |
| PrefilterRoughnessDistanceX | float | The horizontal distance at which the prefilter roughness value will be achieved. |  |
| PrefilterRoughnessLowerBound | float | The Roughness Threshold For Prefilter |  |
| ScreenSizeCullScale | float | The ScreenSize Cull Scale |  |
| FrustumOptim | bool | Frustum Cull Range Optimization |  |
| NoReflectionShadow | bool | Do Not Render Shadow for PlanarRefelction |  |
| FrameBufferCache | bool | Enable FrameBuffer Cache Or Not |  |
