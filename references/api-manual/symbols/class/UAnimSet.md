## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bAnimRotationOnly | uint32 | Indicates that only the rotation should be taken from the animation sequence and the translation should come from the USkeletalMesh ref pose. <br>	 	Note that the root bone always takes translation from the animation, even if this flag is set.<br>	 	You can use the UseTranslationBoneNames array to specify other bones that should use translation with this flag set. |  |
| TrackBoneNames | TArray < FName > | Bone name that each track relates to. TrackBoneName.Num() == Number of tracks. |  |
| LinkupCache | TArray < struct FAnimSetMeshLinkup > | Non-serialised cache of linkups between different skeletal meshes and this AnimSet. |  |
| BoneUseAnimTranslation | TArray < uint8 > | Array of booleans that indicate whether or not to read the translation of a bone from animation or ref skeleton.<br>	 	This is basically a cooked down version of UseTranslationBoneNames for speed.<br>	 	Size matches the number of tracks. |  |
| ForceUseMeshTranslation | TArray < uint8 > | Cooked down version of ForceMeshTranslationBoneNames |  |
| UseTranslationBoneNames | TArray < FName > | Names of bones that should use translation from the animation, if bAnimRotationOnly is set. |  |
| ForceMeshTranslationBoneNames | TArray < FName > | List of bones which are ALWAYS going to use their translation from the mesh and not the animation. |  |
| PreviewSkelMeshName | FName | In the AnimSetEditor, when you switch to this AnimSet, it sees if this skeletal mesh is loaded and if so switches to it. |  |
| BestRatioSkelMeshName | FName | Holds the name of the skeletal mesh whose reference skeleton best matches the TrackBoneName array. |  |
