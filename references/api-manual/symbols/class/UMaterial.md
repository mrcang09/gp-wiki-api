## Description

A Material is an asset which can be applied to a mesh to control the visual look of the scene.
  When light from the scene hits the surface, the shading model of the material is used to calculate how that light interacts with the surface.
 
  Warning: Creating new materials directly increases shader compile times!  Consider creating a Material Instance off of an existing material instead.
