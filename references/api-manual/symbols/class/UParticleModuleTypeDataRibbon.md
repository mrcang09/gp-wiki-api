## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MaxTessellationBetweenParticles | int32 | The maximum amount to tessellate between two particles of the trail. <br>	 	Depending on the distance between the particles and the tangent change, the <br>	 	system will select a number of tessellation points <br>	 		[0..MaxTessellationBetweenParticles] |  |
| SheetsPerTrail | int32 | The number of sheets to render for the trail. |  |
| MaxTrailCount | int32 | The number of live trails |  |
| MaxParticleInTrailCount | int32 | Max particles per trail |  |
| bDeadTrailsOnDeactivate | uint32 | If true, when the system is deactivated, mark trails as dead.<br>	 	This means they will still render, but will not have more particles<br>	 	added to them, even if the system re-activates... |  |
| bDeadTrailsOnSourceLoss | uint32 | If true, when the source of a trail is 'lost' (ie, the source particle<br>	 	dies), mark the current trail as dead. |  |
| bClipSourceSegement | uint32 | If true, do not join the trail to the source position |  |
| bEnablePreviousTangentRecalculation | uint32 | If true, recalculate the previous tangent when a new particle is spawned |  |
| bTangentRecalculationEveryFrame | uint32 | If true, recalculate tangents every frame to allow velocityacceleration to be applied |  |
| bSpawnInitialParticle | uint32 | If true, ribbon will spawn a particle when it first starts moving |  |
| RenderAxis | TEnumAsByte < enum ETrailsRenderAxisOption > | The 'render' axis for the trail (what axis the trail is stretched out on)<br>	 		Trails_CameraUp - Traditional camera-facing trail.<br>	 		Trails_SourceUp - Use the up axis of the source for each spawned particle.<br>	 		Trails_WorldUp  - Use the world up axis. |  |
| TangentSpawningScalar | float | The tangent scalar for spawning.<br>	 	Angles between tangent A and B are mapped to [0.0f .. 1.0f]<br>	 	This is then multiplied by TangentTessellationScalar to give the number of particles to spawn |  |
| bRenderGeometry | uint32 | If true, render the trail geometry (this should typically be on) |  |
| bRenderSpawnPoints | uint32 | If true, render stars at each spawned particle point along the trail |  |
| bRenderTangents | uint32 | If true, render a line showing the tangent at each spawned particle point along the trail |  |
| bRenderTessellation | uint32 | If true, render the tessellated path between spawned particles |  |
| TilingDistance | float | The (estimated) covered distance to tile the 2nd UV set at.<br>	 	If 0.0, a second UV set will not be passed in. |  |
| DistanceTessellationStepSize | float | The distance step size for tessellation.<br>	 	# Tessellation Points = TruncToInt((Distance Between Spawned Particles)  DistanceTessellationStepSize)) |  |
| bEnableTangentDiffInterpScale | uint32 | If this flag is enabled, the system will scale the number of interpolated vertices<br>	 	based on the difference in the tangents of neighboring particles.<br>	 	Each pair of neighboring particles will compute the following CheckTangent value:<br>	 		CheckTangent = ((ParticleA Tangent DOT ParticleB Tangent) - 1.0f)  0.5f<br>	 	If CheckTangent is LESS THAN 0.5, then the DistanceTessellationStepSize will be <br>	 	scaled based on the result. This will map so that from parallel to orthogonal <br>	 	(0..90 degrees) will scale from [0..1]. Anything greater than 90 degrees will clamp <br>	 	at a scale of 1. |  |
| TangentTessellationScalar | float | The tangent scalar for tessellation.<br>	 	Angles between tangent A and B are mapped to [0.0f .. 1.0f]<br>	 	This is then multiplied by TangentTessellationScalar to give the number of points to tessellate |  |
