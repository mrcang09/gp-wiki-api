## Variables

| Name | Type | Description | Redirect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ObjectReferenceList | TArray < UObject * > | List of UObjects that are being kept from being GCd, derived from the asset type map. Arrays are currently more efficient than Sets |  |
| bIsGlobalAsyncScanEnvironment | bool | True if we are running a build that is already scanning assets globally so we can perhaps avoid scanning paths synchronously |  |
| bShouldGuessTypeAndName | bool | True if PrimaryAssetTypeName will be implied for loading assets that don't have it saved on disk. Won't work for all projects |  |
| bShouldUseSynchronousLoad | bool | True if we should always use synchronous loads, this speeds up cooking |  |
| bIsLoadingFromPakFiles | bool | True if we are loading from pak files |  |
| bShouldAcquireMissingChunksOnLoad | bool | True if the chunk install interface should be queries before loading assets |  |
| bOnlyCookProductionAssets | bool | If true, DevelopmentCook assets will error when they are cooked |  |
| bIsBulkScanning | bool | True if we are currently in bulk scanning mode |  |
| bIsPrimaryAssetDirectoryCurrent | bool | True if asset data is current, if false it will need to rescan before PIE |  |
| bIsManagementDatabaseCurrent | bool | True if the asset management database is up to date |  |
| bUpdateManagementDatabaseAfterScan | bool | True if the asset management database should be updated after scan completes |  |
| bIncludeOnlyOnDiskAssets | bool | True if only on-disk assets should be searched by the asset registry |  |
| NumberOfSpawnedNotifications | int32 | Number of notifications seen in this update |  |
